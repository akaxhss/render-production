00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:42,019
Good morning, Sololier.

12
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:45,822
Ready To comply.

13
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:48,574
I have <i>o</i> mission For you.

14
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:52,074
Soncfion and exfrocf.

15
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:54,281
No witnesses.

00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:37,666
VVell 0l
one Sol 'er.

17
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:23,629
<i>All right, what do you see?</i>

18
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:25,789
Standard beat cops.

19
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:28,508
Small station.

20
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:31,795
Quiet street.

21
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:33,797
<i>It's a good target.</i>

22
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:36,092
There's an ATM on the
south corner, which means?

23
00:03:36,258 --> 00:03:37,305
Cameras.

24
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:39,140
<i>Both cross streets are one-way.</i>

25
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:40,849
So, compromised escape routes.

26
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:43,436
Means our guy doesn't
care about being seen.

27
00:03:43,515 --> 00:03:45,609
He isn't afraid
to make a mess on the way out.

28
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:47,652
You see that Range Rover
halfway up the block?

29
00:03:47,853 --> 00:03:49,730
Yeah, the red one? It's cute.

30
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:50,939
<i>It's also bulletproof,</i>

31
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:52,274
<i>which means private security...</i>

32
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:53,779
<i>which means more guns...</i>

33
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:56,453
<i>which means more headaches
for somebody. Probably us.</i>

34
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:59,031
You guys know
I can move things with my mind, right?

35
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:01,909
Looking over your shoulder
needs to become second nature.

36
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:04,829
Anybody ever tell you
you're a little paranoid?

37
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:07,209
<i>Not to my face.
Why? Did you hear something?</i>

38
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,502
<i>STEVE". Eyes on target, folks.</i>

39
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:10,254
This is the best lead
we've had on Rumlow

40
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:11,550
in six months. I don't want to lose him.

41
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:14,091
If he sees us coming,
that won't be a problem.

42
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:15,514
He kind of hates us.

43
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:20,268
Sam...

44
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:21,849
see that garbage truck?

45
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:23,229
Tag it.

46
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:42,874
Give me X-ray.

47
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:49,711
That truck's loaded for max weight.

48
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:50,882
And the driver's armed.

49
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,042
It's a battering ram.

50
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:53,210
- Go now.
- What?

51
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:55,591
He's not hitting the police.

52
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:01,741
Body armour, AR-15s.

53
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:03,492
<i>I make seven hostiles.</i>

54
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:13,666
I make five.

55
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,176
Sam.

56
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:24,809
<i>Four.</i>

57
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:30,728
Rumlow's on the third floor.

58
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:32,184
Wanda, just like we practised.

59
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:33,351
What about the gas?

60
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:34,523
Get it out.

61
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:53,542
Pack it up.

62
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:32,126
He's here.

63
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:37,378
Rumlow has a biological weapon.

64
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,883
I'm on it.

65
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:15,920
I don't work like that no more.

66
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:20,083
Fire in the hole.

67
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:26,635
MERCI No!

68
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:50,618
Sam.

69
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:52,950
<i>He's in an AF V heading north.</i>

70
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,622
Take this to the airstrip.

71
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,791
We're not gonna outrun them.
Lose the truck.

72
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,387
Where are you going to meet us?

73
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:11,969
I'm not.

74
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,027
I've got four, they're splitting up.

75
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:31,496
I got the two on the left.

76
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:41,213
They ditched their gear.

77
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:43,090
It's a shell game now.
One of them has the payload.

78
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,098
There you are, you son of a bitch.

79
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:53,430
I've been waiting for this.

80
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,032
He doesn't have it.

81
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:13,488
I'm empty!

82
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:14,948
Out of the way!

83
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:55,576
Drop it.

84
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:56,914
Or I'll drop this.

85
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:00,539
- Drop it!
- He'll do it!

86
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:09,757
Payload secure. Thanks, Sam.

87
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:10,928
Don't thank me.

88
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,680
I'm not thanking that thing.

89
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:13,923
His name is Redwing.

90
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,262
<i>I'm still not thanking it.</i>

91
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,433
He's cute. Go ahead, pet him.

92
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:24,267
Come on!

93
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:34,577
This is for dropping
a building on my face.

94
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:53,884
Ahh!

95
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:58,593
I think I look pretty good,
all things considered.

96
00:11:58,801 --> 00:11:59,768
Who's your buyer?

97
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:01,976
You know, he knew you.

98
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,186
Your pal, your buddy, your Bucky.

99
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:06,775
What did you say?

100
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:08,653
He remembered you.

101
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:11,694
I was there. He got all weepy about it.

102
00:12:13,191 --> 00:12:14,989
Till they put his brain back in a blender.

103
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:17,654
He wanted you to know something.

104
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:18,784
He said to me...

105
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:21,370
"Please tell Rogers.

106
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:23,243
"When you gotta go...

107
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:25,169
"YOU gotta go,"

108
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:28,623
And you're coming with me.

109
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,271
Oh, my...

110
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:51,362
Sam...

111
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:54,486
we need Fire and Rescue

112
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:56,192
on the south side of the building.

113
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:58,281
We gotta get up there.

114
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:11,792
<i>Try to remember the kind of September</i>

115
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:15,629
<i>When grass was green</i>

116
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,052
Wake up, dear,
and say goodbye to your father.

117
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:20,842
Who's the homeless person
on the couch?

118
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:24,396
This is why
I love coming home for Christmas...

119
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:25,806
right before you leave town.

120
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:28,225
Be nice, dear,
he's been studying abroad.

121
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:30,234
Really? Which broad?
What's her name?

122
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:31,736
Candice.

123
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:33,320
Do me a favour?

124
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:34,898
Try not to burn
the house down before Monday.

125
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:36,236
Okay, so it's Monday.

126
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:37,571
That is good to know,

127
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,573
I will plan my toga party accordingly.

128
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,412
Where you going?

129
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:42,663
Your father's flying us

130
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:44,082
to the Bahamas for a little getaway.

131
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,742
We might have to make a quick stop.

132
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,998
At the Pentagon. Right?

133
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:51,172
Don't worry, you're gonna love
the holiday menu at the commissary.

134
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:54,000
They say sarcasm
is a metric for potential.

135
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,006
If that's true,
you'll be a great man someday.

136
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:57,512
I'll get the bags.

137
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:02,342
He does miss you when you're not here.

138
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:07,438
And frankly, you're going to miss us.

139
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:09,857
Because this is the last time

140
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:11,525
we're all going to be together.

141
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:14,813
You know what's about to happen.

142
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:16,777
Say something.

143
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,950
If you don't, you'll regret it.

144
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:24,114
I love you, Dad.

145
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,534
And I know you did the best you could.

146
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:45,351
That's how I wish it happened.

147
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:50,398
Binarily Augmented Retro-Framing...

148
00:14:50,473 --> 00:14:51,599
or BARF.

149
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:53,480
God, I gotta work on that acronym.

150
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,937
An extremely costly method

151
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,273
of hijacking the hippocampus...

152
00:14:58,356 --> 00:15:02,486
to clear traumatic memories.

153
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:06,246
Huh.

154
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:07,581
It doesn't change the fact

155
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:09,500
that they never made it to the airport...

156
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:13,208
or all the things I did to avoid
processing my grief, but...

157
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:19,510
Plus, $611 million for my
little therapeutic experiment?

158
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:24,223
No one in their right mind
would've ever funded it.

159
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:28,057
Help me out,
what's the MIT mission statement?

160
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:29,471
"To generate, disseminate...

161
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:32,349
"and preserve knowledge.

162
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,605
"And work with others...

163
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:37,528
"to bring it to bear on
the world's great challenges."

164
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:41,274
Well, you are the others.

165
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:43,868
And, quiet as it's kept...

166
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,616
the challenges facing you

167
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:47,117
are the greatest mankind's ever known.

168
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:49,908
Plus, most of you are broke.

169
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:51,955
Oh, I'm sorry. Rather, you were.

170
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:53,370
As of this moment...

171
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:55,789
every student has been made
an equal recipient...

172
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:58,876
of the inaugural
September Foundation Grant.

173
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,460
As in...

174
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:03,471
all of your projects have
just been approved and funded.

175
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:09,310
No strings, no taxes...

176
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:11,642
just reframe the future!

177
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,477
Starting now.

178
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:24,317
Go break some eggs.

179
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:33,792
Wow. Wow.

180
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:37,584
That took my breath away.

181
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:39,169
Oh, Tony! So generous.

182
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:41,505
So much money! Wow!

183
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,419
Out of curiosity...

184
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:46,385
will any portion of that grant
be made available to faculty?

185
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:47,841
I know, "Ooh, gross," but hear me out.

186
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:50,177
I have got this killer idea
for a self-cooking hotdog.

187
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:51,351
Basically,
chemical detonator embedded...

188
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:52,394
Restroom's this way, yeah?

189
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:53,596
Yeah. Embedded in the meat shaft.

190
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:56,023
Mr Stark, I am so sorry
about the teleprompter.

191
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:57,520
I didn't know Miss Potts had cancelled.

192
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,352
They didn't have time to fix it.

193
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:02,946
It's fine. I'll be right back.

194
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:04,444
We'll catch up later.

195
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:25,469
That was nice,
what you did for those young people.

196
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:27,630
Ah, they deserve it.

197
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:29,970
Plus, it helps ease my conscience.

198
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:35,147
They say there's a correlation
between generosity and guilt.

199
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:38,816
But if you've got the money...

200
00:17:39,684 --> 00:17:41,812
break as many eggs as you like.

201
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:43,939
Right?

202
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:53,539
Are you going up?

203
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:56,204
I'm right where I want to be.

204
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:58,084
Okay. Hey.

205
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:04,049
Sorry, it's an occupational hazard.

206
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,880
I work for the State Department.

207
00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:08,342
Human Resources.

208
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:10,590
I know it's boring...

209
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:14,177
but it enabled me to raise a son.

210
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:17,935
I'm very proud of what he grew up to be.

211
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:22,526
His name was Charlie Spencer.

212
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,021
You murdered him.

213
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,283
In Sokovia.

214
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:34,122
Not that that matters in the least to you.

215
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,909
You think you fight for us?

216
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,371
You just fight for yourself.

217
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:46,042
Who's going to avenge my son, Stark?

218
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:49,220
He's dead...

219
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:51,556
and I blame you.

220
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:01,314
<i>11</i> Wakandans were

221
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,518
<i>among those killed
during a confrontation...</i>

222
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:05,820
<i>between the Avengers
and a group of mercenaries...</i>

223
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:07,943
<i>in Lagos, Nigeria last month.</i>

224
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:09,486
<i>The traditionally reclusive Wakandans</i>

225
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:10,862
<i>were on an outreach mission...</i>

226
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:12,693
<i>in Lagos, when the attack occurred.</i>

227
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:16,076
<i>Our people's blood is spilled
on foreign soil...</i>

228
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:19,910
<i>not only because of
the actions of criminals...</i>

229
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:23,922
<i>but by the indifference
of those pledged to stop them.</i>

230
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,966
<i>Victory at the expense of the innocent...</i>

231
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:29,422
<i>is no victory at all.</i>

232
00:19:29,627 --> 00:19:31,174
The Wakandan <i>king</i> went on to...

233
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,888
<i>They are operating outside</i>

234
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:34,715
<i>and above the international law.</i>

235
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,016
<i>Because that's the reality,</i>

236
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:37,685
<i>if we don't respond to acts like these.</i>

237
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,845
<i>What legal authority does an enhanced</i>

238
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:41,681
<i>individual like Wanda Maximoff have...</i>

239
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:43,107
<i>to operate in Nigeri...?</i>

240
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:48,939
It's my fault.

241
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:50,356
That's not true.

242
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:51,524
Turn the TV back on.

243
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:53,739
They're being very specific.

244
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:57,364
I should've clocked that bomb vest
long before you had to deal with it.

245
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,161
Rumlow said "Bucky"...

246
00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:03,502
and all of a sudden
I was a 16-year-old kid again,

247
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:04,624
in Brooklyn.

248
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,467
And people died.

249
00:20:12,503 --> 00:20:13,504
It's on me.

250
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:15,969
It's on both of us.

251
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:18,384
This job...

252
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:23,226
We try to save
as many people as we can.

253
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,896
Sometimes that doesn't
mean everybody.

254
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:27,984
But if we can't find a way
to live with that...

255
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:30,067
then next time...

256
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:33,153
maybe nobody gets saved.

257
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:39,405
Vis! We talked about this.

258
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:42,207
Yes, but the door was open
so I assumed that...

259
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:46,921
Captain Rogers wished to know
when Mr Stark was arriving.

260
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,547
Thank you. We'll be right down.

261
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:51,254
I'll use the door.

262
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,595
Oh, and apparently,
he's brought a guest.

263
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:56,472
We know who it is?

264
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,473
The Secretary of State.

265
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:03,187
<i>Five years ago...</i>

266
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,431
I had a heart attack...

267
00:21:05,723 --> 00:21:08,772
and dropped right in
the middle of my backswing.

268
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,983
Turned out it was the best
round of my life...

269
00:21:12,146 --> 00:21:14,274
because after 13 hours of surgery

270
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:16,154
and a triple bypass...

271
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:20,822
I found something 40 years
in the Army had never taught me.

272
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:22,702
Perspective.

273
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:28,789
The world owes the Avengers
an unpayable debt.

274
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:32,546
You have fought for us...

275
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:35,841
protected us, risked your lives...

276
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:40,141
but while a great many people
see you as heroes...

277
00:21:40,216 --> 00:21:42,218
there are some...

278
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:45,562
who would prefer the word "vigilantes."

279
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,977
What word would you use,
Mr Secretary?

280
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,357
How about "dangerous"?

281
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,819
What would you call
a group of US-based,

282
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:55,023
enhanced individuals...

283
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:58,159
who routinely ignore
sovereign borders...

284
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:01,947
and inflict their will
wherever they choose...

285
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:04,240
and who, frankly, seem unconcerned

286
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,575
about what they leave behind?

287
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:12,172
New York.

288
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:27,722
Washington, D.C.

289
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:37,318
Sokovia.

290
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,076
Lagos.

291
00:22:58,544 --> 00:23:00,171
Okay. That's enough.

292
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:03,473
For the past four years,

293
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:04,892
you've operated with unlimited power...

294
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,802
and no supervision.

295
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:08,850
That's an arrangement
the governments of the world

296
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:10,931
can no longer tolerate.

297
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:15,815
But I think we have a solution.

298
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:21,909
The Sokovia Accords.

299
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:25,196
Approved by 117 countries...

300
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:28,241
it states that the Avengers

301
00:23:28,324 --> 00:23:30,793
shall no longer be a private organisation.

302
00:23:30,993 --> 00:23:32,210
Instead...

303
00:23:32,453 --> 00:23:34,581
they'll operate under the supervision

304
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:36,586
of a United Nations panel...

305
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:41,095
only when and if that panel
deems it necessary.

306
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:45,258
The Avengers were formed to
make the world a safer place.

307
00:23:45,758 --> 00:23:46,975
I feel we've done that.

308
00:23:47,343 --> 00:23:51,143
Tell me, Captain, do you know
where Thor and Banner are right now?

309
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:54,934
If I misplaced a couple of
30 megaton nukes...

310
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:57,444
you can bet there'd be consequences.

311
00:23:57,937 --> 00:24:02,158
Compromise. Reassurance.
That's how the world works.

312
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:05,369
Believe me, this is the middle ground.

313
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,914
So, there are contingencies.

314
00:24:09,365 --> 00:24:12,039
Three days from now,
the UN meets in Vienna...

315
00:24:12,201 --> 00:24:14,203
to ratify the Accords.

316
00:24:16,372 --> 00:24:17,965
Talk it over.

317
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:23,299
And if we come
to a decision you don't like?

318
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:26,848
Then you retire.

319
00:24:50,072 --> 00:24:51,073
Hello?

320
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:55,044
Is this your car out front?

321
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,418
Ijumped the kerb.

322
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,041
Maybe we could...

323
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:03,172
take care of it ourselves.

324
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:05,383
If you wanna call the cops,
that's okay, too...

325
00:25:05,546 --> 00:25:06,968
- I guess.
- No.

326
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:10,430
No cops.

327
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:11,552
Thank you.

328
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:51,425
You have kept your looks, Colonel.

329
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:53,052
Congratulations.

330
00:25:57,139 --> 00:26:01,144
"Mission report. December 16, 1991."

331
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:02,778
Who are you?

332
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:05,822
My name is Zemo.

333
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:09,201
I will repeat my question.

334
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:14,699
Mission report, December 16, 1991.

335
00:26:14,865 --> 00:26:16,663
How did you find me?

336
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:18,793
When S.H.l.E.L.D. fell...

337
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:22,422
Black Widow released
HYDRA files to the public.

338
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:25,255
Millions of pages. Much of it encrypted.

339
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:27,052
Not easy to decipher.

340
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:32,257
But, I have experience.

341
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:34,760
And patience.

342
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:38,184
A man can do anything if he has those.

343
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:40,432
What do you want?

344
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:43,560
Mission report.

345
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:45,570
December 16.

346
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:47,151
1991.

347
00:26:47,898 --> 00:26:51,323
Go... to... hell!

348
00:27:05,499 --> 00:27:07,843
HYDRA deserves its place
on the ash heap.

349
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,929
So your death would not bother me.

350
00:27:11,547 --> 00:27:13,515
But I'd have to use this book...

351
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:17,186
and other bloodier methods
to find what I need.

352
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:19,563
I don't look forward to that.

353
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:23,359
You'd only be dying for...

354
00:27:23,517 --> 00:27:24,894
your pride.

355
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:42,207
Hail HYDRA.

356
00:27:53,547 --> 00:27:56,016
Secretary Ross has
a Congressional Medal of Honour...

357
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:57,263
which is one more than you have.

358
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:59,182
So let's say we agree to this thing.

359
00:27:59,261 --> 00:28:01,104
How long is it gonna be
before they LoJack us

360
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,477
like a bunch of common criminals?

361
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:04,687
117 countries want to sign this.

362
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:07,519
117, Sam, and you're just like,
"No, that's cool. We got it."

363
00:28:07,603 --> 00:28:08,695
How long are you going
to play both sides?

364
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:09,942
I have an equation.

365
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:11,982
Oh, this will clear it up.

366
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,117
In the eight years since Mr Stark

367
00:28:14,193 --> 00:28:15,661
announced himself as Iron Man...

368
00:28:15,736 --> 00:28:19,206
the number of known enhanced persons
has grown exponentially.

369
00:28:20,908 --> 00:28:22,205
During the same period...

370
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:24,495
the number of potentially
world-ending events

371
00:28:24,578 --> 00:28:26,125
has risen at a commensurate rate.

372
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:27,582
Are you saying it's our fault?

373
00:28:27,998 --> 00:28:30,467
I'm saying there may be a causality.

374
00:28:32,461 --> 00:28:35,214
Our very strength invites challenge.

375
00:28:35,297 --> 00:28:37,925
Challenge incites conflict.

376
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:39,889
And conflict...

377
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:43,681
breeds catastrophe.

378
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:45,227
Oversight...

379
00:28:47,643 --> 00:28:50,567
Oversight is not an idea that
can be dismissed out of hand.

380
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:51,813
Boom.

381
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:53,906
Tony.

382
00:28:54,066 --> 00:28:56,694
You are being uncharacteristically
non-hyperverbal.

383
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:57,986
It's because he's already
made up his mind.

384
00:28:58,237 --> 00:29:00,114
Boy, you know me so well.

385
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:03,617
Actually, I'm nursing
an electromagnetic headache.

386
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:07,292
That's what's going on, Cap.
It's just pain.

387
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:09,960
It's discomfort.

388
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,042
Who's putting coffee grounds
in the disposal?

389
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:15,504
Am I running a bed and breakfast
for a biker gang?

390
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,387
Oh, that's Charles Spencer, by the way.

391
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:24,892
He's a great kid.

392
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:28,438
Computer engineering degree,
3.6 GPA...

393
00:29:28,642 --> 00:29:31,191
had a floor-level gig
at Intel planned for the fall.

394
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:33,780
But first, he wanted to put
a few miles on his soul...

395
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:36,650
before he parked it
behind a desk. See the world.

396
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:38,326
Maybe be of service.

397
00:29:39,069 --> 00:29:40,491
Charlie didn't want to go to Vegas or

398
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:42,038
Fort Lauderdale,
which is what I would do.

399
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:44,833
He didn't go to Paris or Amsterdam,
which sounds fun.

400
00:29:44,992 --> 00:29:46,960
He decided to spend his summer

401
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:48,537
building sustainable housing
for the poor.

402
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,122
Guess where. Sokovia.

403
00:29:54,001 --> 00:29:55,253
He wanted to make
a difference, I suppose.

404
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:56,799
We won't know because we dropped

405
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:59,006
a building on him
while we were kicking ass.

406
00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:09,892
There's no decision-making
process here.

407
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:12,773
We need to be put in check!

408
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:15,439
Whatever form that takes, I'm game.

409
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:16,652
If we can't accept limitations,

410
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:17,779
if we're boundary-less...

411
00:30:17,858 --> 00:30:19,986
we're no better than the bad guys.

412
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:22,571
Tony, someone dies on your watch,
you don't give up.

413
00:30:22,863 --> 00:30:23,534
Who said we're giving up?

414
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:26,207
We are if we're not
taking responsibility for our actions.

415
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:28,164
This document just shifts the blame.

416
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:30,000
I'm sorry, Steve.

417
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:31,755
That is dangerously arrogant.

418
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:34,041
This is the United Nations
we're talking about.

419
00:30:34,124 --> 00:30:36,422
It's not the World Security Council,

420
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:37,753
it's not S.H.l.E.L.D., it's not HYDRA.

421
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,216
No, but it's run by people

422
00:30:39,296 --> 00:30:40,673
with agendas, and agendas change.

423
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,682
That's good. That's why I'm here.

424
00:30:42,758 --> 00:30:45,352
When I realised what my weapons
were capable of in the wrong hands...

425
00:30:45,427 --> 00:30:46,929
I shut it down
and stopped manufacturing.

426
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:49,515
Tony, you chose to do that.

427
00:30:49,598 --> 00:30:52,522
If we sign this, we surrender
our right to choose.

428
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:55,862
What if this panel sends us somewhere
we don't think we should go?

429
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:57,364
What if there is somewhere
we need to go

430
00:30:57,439 --> 00:30:58,440
and they don't let us?

431
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,192
We may not be perfect,

432
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:01,993
but the safest hands are still our own.

433
00:31:02,152 --> 00:31:04,575
If we don't do this now,

434
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:06,327
it's gonna be done to us later.

435
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:08,413
That's the fact. That won't be pretty.

436
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:09,747
You're saying they'll come for me.

437
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:11,203
We would protect you.

438
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:13,084
Maybe Tony's right.

439
00:31:14,373 --> 00:31:16,751
If we have one hand on the wheel,

440
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:18,927
we can still steer. If we take it off...

441
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:20,720
Aren't you the same woman
who told the government

442
00:31:20,796 --> 00:31:22,264
to kiss her ass a few years ago?

443
00:31:22,381 --> 00:31:24,725
I'm just reading the terrain.

444
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:28,182
We have made some
very public mistakes.

445
00:31:28,345 --> 00:31:30,393
We need to win their trust back.

446
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:32,683
Focus up. I'm sorry.
Did I just mishear you...

447
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:34,817
-or did you agree with me?
- I want to take it back now.

448
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:35,818
No, you can't retract it.

449
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:37,062
Thank you. Unprecedented.

450
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:41,449
Okay. Case closed. I win.

451
00:31:42,818 --> 00:31:43,990
I have to go.

452
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:29,744
And now, I would like
to invite Sharon Carter

453
00:32:29,823 --> 00:32:31,416
to come up and say a few words.

454
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:48,308
Margaret Carter was known to most
as a founder of S.H.l.E.L.D...

455
00:32:49,259 --> 00:32:51,353
but I just knew her as Aunt Peggy.

456
00:32:53,722 --> 00:32:55,565
She had a photograph in her office.

457
00:32:55,849 --> 00:32:58,853
Aunt Peggy standing next to JFK.

458
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,563
As a kid, that was pretty cool.

459
00:33:01,855 --> 00:33:04,233
But it was a lot to live up to.

460
00:33:04,441 --> 00:33:06,739
Which is why I never told
anyone we were related.

461
00:33:08,153 --> 00:33:10,281
I asked her once how she managed

462
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:12,240
to master diplomacy and espionage...

463
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:16,753
in a time when no one wanted to see
a woman succeed at either.

464
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:19,088
She said, compromise where you can.

465
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:23,218
But where you can't, don't.

466
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:29,634
Even if everyone is telling you
that something wrong is something right.

467
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:33,053
Even if the whole world
is telling you to move...

468
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:36,857
it is your duty to plant
yourself like a tree...

469
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:41,524
look them in the eye and say
"No, you move."

470
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,368
When I came out of the ice,

471
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:57,828
I thought everyone
I had known was gone.

472
00:33:58,578 --> 00:34:00,706
Then I found out she was alive.

473
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:03,295
I was just lucky to have her.

474
00:34:03,917 --> 00:34:05,260
She had you back, too.

475
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:09,180
Who else signed?

476
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,847
Tony, Rhodey, Vision.

477
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,761
Clint?

478
00:34:15,554 --> 00:34:17,147
Says he's retired.

479
00:34:17,347 --> 00:34:19,145
- Wanda?
- TBD.

480
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:23,486
I'm off to Vienna
for the signing of the Accords.

481
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:25,275
There's plenty of room on the jet.

482
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:31,994
Just because it's the path
of least resistance...

483
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:34,372
doesn't mean it's the wrong path.

484
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:37,413
Staying together is more important
than how we stay together.

485
00:34:38,285 --> 00:34:40,413
What are we giving up to do it?

486
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:45,876
I'm sorry, Nat.

487
00:34:46,126 --> 00:34:47,799
I can't sign it.

488
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:50,213
I know.

489
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:54,054
Then what are you doing here?

490
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:59,184
I didn't want you to be alone.

491
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:07,154
Come here.

492
00:35:12,694 --> 00:35:15,618
At a <i>special
United Nations conference...</i>

493
00:35:15,697 --> 00:35:18,246
<i>117 countries have come together</i>

494
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:21,040
<i>to ratify the Sokovia Accords.</i>

495
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,508
Excuse me, Ms Romanoff?

496
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:28,210
- Yes?
- These need your signature.

497
00:35:29,878 --> 00:35:31,221
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

498
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:35,718
I suppose neither of us
is used to the spotlight.

499
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:39,061
Oh, well, it's not always so flattering.

500
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:41,557
You seem to be doing all right so far.

501
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:44,066
Considering your last trip
to Capitol Hill...

502
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:48,147
I wouldn't think you'd be particularly
comfortable in this company.

503
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:49,355
Well, I'm not.

504
00:35:49,439 --> 00:35:52,283
And that alone makes me glad
you are here, Ms Romanoff.

505
00:35:52,442 --> 00:35:54,240
Why? You don't approve of all this?

506
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:57,664
The Accords, yes.
The politics, not really.

507
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:01,581
Two people in a room can get
more done than a hundred.

508
00:36:01,743 --> 00:36:04,087
Unless you need to move a piano.

509
00:36:06,623 --> 00:36:07,670
Ms Romanoff.

510
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:08,879
King T'Chaka.

511
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:11,754
Please, allow me to apologise
for what happened in Nigeria.

512
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,467
Thank you.

513
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:15,849
Thank you for agreeing to all of this.

514
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:19,261
I'm sad to hear that Captain Rogers
will not be joining us today.

515
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:20,728
Yes, so am I.

516
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:22,355
If everyone <i>could please</i> be seated.

517
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:24,182
<i>This assembly is now in session.</i>

518
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,272
That is the future calling.

519
00:36:28,103 --> 00:36:29,229
Such a pleasure.

520
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:30,609
Thank you.

521
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:35,661
For <i>o</i> mon
who disopproves of oliplomocy,

522
00:36:36,361 --> 00:36:38,284
you're gefiing quite good of I'r.

523
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:40,456
I'm happy, Father.

524
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:46,204
Thank you.

525
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:48,085
Thank you.

526
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:51,296
<i>When stolen
Wakandan vibranium</i>

527
00:36:51,376 --> 00:36:54,300
<i>was used to make a terrible weapon...</i>

528
00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:58,350
<i>we in Wakanda were forced
to question our legacy.</i>

529
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:01,261
Those men and women
killed in Nigeria...

530
00:37:01,428 --> 00:37:03,351
were part of a goodwill mission

531
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:05,558
from a country too long in the shadows.

532
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:10,987
We will not, however,
let misfortune drive us back.

533
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:14,783
We will fight to improve
the world we wish to join.

534
00:37:15,275 --> 00:37:19,030
I am grateful to the Avengers
for supporting this initiative.

535
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:23,291
Wakanda is proud

536
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:25,289
to extend its hand in peace.

537
00:37:25,452 --> 00:37:26,453
Everybody get down!

538
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:04,366
My mom tried to
talk me out of enlisting...

539
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:05,954
but, um, not Aunt Peggy.

540
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:08,119
She bought me my first thigh holster.

541
00:38:08,453 --> 00:38:10,171
Very practical.

542
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:11,707
And stylish.

543
00:38:17,462 --> 00:38:19,715
CIA has you stationed over here now?

544
00:38:19,881 --> 00:38:21,554
Berlin. Joint Terrorism Task Force.

545
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:23,893
Right. Right. Sounds fun.

546
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:26,020
I know, right?

547
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:31,067
I've been meaning to ask you.

548
00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:34,150
When you were spying on me
from across the hall...

549
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:35,612
You mean when I was doing my job.

550
00:38:38,608 --> 00:38:39,825
Did Peggy know?

551
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:44,371
She kept so many secrets.

552
00:38:44,948 --> 00:38:46,575
I didn't want her to have one from you.

553
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,463
Thanks for walking me back.

554
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:54,214
Sure.

555
00:38:57,669 --> 00:38:58,841
Steve.

556
00:38:59,087 --> 00:39:00,714
There's something you gotta see.

557
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:02,765
<i>A</i> bomb <i>hidden</i> in a news van...

558
00:39:02,924 --> 00:39:03,925
Who's coordinating?

559
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:05,017
<i>Ripped through
the UN building in Vienna.</i>

560
00:39:05,093 --> 00:39:06,185
Good. They're solid. Forensics?

561
00:39:06,261 --> 00:39:07,262
<i>More than 70 people have been injured.</i>

562
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:11,228
<i>At least 12 are dead,
including Wakanda's King T'Chaka.</i>

563
00:39:11,391 --> 00:39:13,189
<i>Officials have released
a video of a suspect...</i>

564
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:15,774
<i>who they have identified
as James Buchanan Barnes...</i>

565
00:39:15,937 --> 00:39:17,359
<i>the Winter Soldier.</i>

566
00:39:17,522 --> 00:39:18,944
<i>The infamous HYDRA agent...</i>

567
00:39:19,107 --> 00:39:22,111
<i>linked to numerous acts of terrorism
and political assassinations.</i>

568
00:39:22,277 --> 00:39:23,779
I have to go to work.

569
00:39:29,534 --> 00:39:32,754
Call MI6, see if we can get
Micro Forensics to hurry this up.

570
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:34,129
We need the whole team
here in two hours

571
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:35,297
or it's not worth it.

572
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:46,722
I'm very sorry.

573
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:55,102
In my culture...

574
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:58,154
death is not the end.

575
00:39:59,981 --> 00:40:03,030
It's more of a stepping-off point.

576
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:05,695
You reach outwith both hands...

577
00:40:05,987 --> 00:40:08,240
and Bast and Sekhmet,

578
00:40:08,323 --> 00:40:10,917
they lead you into the green veldt...

579
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:13,874
where you can run forever.

580
00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:16,419
That sounds very peaceful.

581
00:40:17,916 --> 00:40:20,010
My father thought so.

582
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,014
I am not my father.

583
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,347
T'Challa...

584
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,343
Task Force will decide
who brings in Barnes.

585
00:40:30,595 --> 00:40:32,723
Don't bother, Ms Romanoff.

586
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:35,274
I'll kill him myself.

587
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:42,941
Yeah?

588
00:40:43,024 --> 00:40:44,276
You all right?

589
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:47,036
<i>Uh, yeah, thanks. I got lucky.</i>

590
00:40:53,034 --> 00:40:56,629
I know how much Barnes
means to you. I really do.

591
00:40:57,622 --> 00:41:00,626
Stay home. You'll only make this worse.

592
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:02,218
<i>For all of us.</i>

593
00:41:02,502 --> 00:41:03,549
<i>Please.</i>

594
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:04,717
Are you saying you'll arrest me?

595
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:06,381
No.

596
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,387
Someone will.

597
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:10,768
<i>If you interfere.
That's how it works now.</i>

598
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:14,064
If he's this far gone, Nat,
I should be the one to bring him in.

599
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:15,397
<i>Why?</i>

600
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:17,896
Because I'm the one
least likely to die trying.

601
00:41:19,978 --> 00:41:20,854
Shit.

602
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,243
She tell you to stay out of it?

603
00:41:28,987 --> 00:41:29,988
Might have a point.

604
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:31,280
He'd do it for me.

605
00:41:31,531 --> 00:41:32,953
1945, maybe.

606
00:41:33,074 --> 00:41:35,827
I just want to make sure
we consider all our options.

607
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:37,496
The people that shoot at you

608
00:41:37,704 --> 00:41:39,081
usually wind up shooting at me.

609
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:44,260
Tips have been pouring in
since that footage went public.

610
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:46,337
Everybody thinks
the Winter Soldier goes to their gym.

611
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:48,423
Most of it's noise.

612
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:49,928
Except for this.

613
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:54,270
My boss expects a briefing,
pretty much now...

614
00:41:54,429 --> 00:41:56,602
so that's all the head start
you're gonna get.

615
00:41:56,681 --> 00:41:57,773
Thank you.

616
00:41:57,849 --> 00:41:59,601
You're gonna have to hurry.

617
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:02,236
We have orders to shoot on sight.

618
00:42:08,443 --> 00:42:11,322

You're Steve.

635
00:44:45,433 --> 00:44:47,686
I read about you in a museum.

636
00:44:48,269 --> 00:44:50,021
<i>SAM". They've set the perimeter.</i>

637
00:44:51,063 --> 00:44:52,610
I know you're nervous,

638
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:54,158
and you have plenty of reason to be.

639
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:57,487
But you're lying.

640
00:44:58,738 --> 00:45:00,740
I wasn't in Vienna.
I don't do that any more.

<i>They're entering the building.</i>

642
00:45:02,158 --> 00:45:04,752
Well, the people
who think you did are coming here now.

643
00:45:04,869 --> 00:45:06,667
And they're not planning
on taking you alive.

644
00:45:06,787 --> 00:45:08,289
That's smart.

645
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:09,589
Good strategy.

<i>They're on the roof. I'm compromised.</i>

647

656
00:46:01,717 --> 00:46:03,060
I'm not gonna kill anyone.

657
00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:50,937
Suspect nos broken containment!

658
00:46:51,267 --> 00:46:52,063
“He's headed olown the eosf sfoirwe"!

659
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:04,405
Come on, man.

660
00:47:26,552 --> 00:47:27,553
Ahhh!

661
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:10,975
Sam, southwest rooftop.

662
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:12,435
<i>SAM". Who the hell's the other guy?</i>

663
00:48:12,515 --> 00:48:13,767
About to find out.

664
00:48:26,445 --> 00:48:28,243
<i>- Sam.
- Got him.</i>

665
00:49:09,864 --> 00:49:11,241
Stand <i>down!</i>

666
00:49:13,868 --> 00:49:14,869
<i>Stand down!</i>

667
00:49:43,898 --> 00:49:45,400
Sam, I can't shake this guy.

668
00:49:45,566 --> 00:49:46,738
Right behind you.

669
00:51:21,829 --> 00:51:23,877
Stand down, now.

670
00:51:31,005 --> 00:51:32,723
<i>Congratulations, Cap.</i>

671
00:51:33,007 --> 00:51:34,634
<i>You're a criminal.</i>

672
00:51:57,364 --> 00:51:58,581
<i>Your Highness.</i>

673
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:07,007
"A pinch of paprika."

674
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:08,125
A pinch.

675
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,797
Is that paprikash?

676
00:52:13,922 --> 00:52:17,222
I thought it might lift your spirits.

677
00:52:30,731 --> 00:52:32,733
Spirits lifted.

678
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:36,241
In my defence,

679
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:39,164
I haven't actually ever eaten
anything before, so...

680
00:52:39,281 --> 00:52:40,498
May I?

681
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:41,450
Please.

682
00:52:48,666 --> 00:52:49,918
- Wanda?
- Hmm.

683
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:52,044
No one dislikes you, Wanda.

684
00:52:54,505 --> 00:52:55,472
Thanks.

685
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:56,636
Oh, you're welcome.

686
00:52:56,840 --> 00:53:00,185
No, it's a involuntary response
in their amygdala.

687
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:02,388
They can't help but be afraid of you.

688
00:53:02,554 --> 00:53:03,521
Are you?

689
00:53:03,597 --> 00:53:05,395
My amygdala is synthetic, so...

690
00:53:09,103 --> 00:53:12,277
I used to think of myself one way.

691
00:53:13,941 --> 00:53:15,864
But after this...

692
00:53:16,276 --> 00:53:18,449
I am something else.

693
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:22,116
I'm still me, I think, but...

694
00:53:24,243 --> 00:53:26,917
that's not what everyone else sees.

695
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,008
Do you know, I don't know what this is?

696
00:53:33,127 --> 00:53:34,128
Not really.

697
00:53:34,628 --> 00:53:36,380
I know it's not of this world...

698
00:53:36,588 --> 00:53:37,965
that it powered Loki's staff,

699
00:53:38,090 --> 00:53:40,309
gave you your abilities, but...

700
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:44,980
its true nature is a mystery.

701
00:53:45,264 --> 00:53:47,141
And yet, it is part of me.

702
00:53:47,349 --> 00:53:48,475
Are you afraid of it?

703
00:53:49,309 --> 00:53:51,653
I wish to understand it.

704
00:53:51,812 --> 00:53:53,985
The more I do, the less it controls me.

705
00:53:54,148 --> 00:53:57,072
One day... who knows?

706
00:53:57,234 --> 00:53:58,486
I may even control it.

707
00:54:01,196 --> 00:54:05,042
I don't know what's in this
but it is not paprika.

708
00:54:05,826 --> 00:54:07,920
I'm gonna go to the store.

709
00:54:08,537 --> 00:54:10,539
I'll be back in 20 minutes.

710
00:54:10,748 --> 00:54:13,843
Alternatively, we could order a pizza?

711
00:54:15,002 --> 00:54:17,881
Vision, are you not letting me leave?

712
00:54:19,548 --> 00:54:21,346
It is a question of safety.

713
00:54:21,508 --> 00:54:23,431
I can protect myself.

714
00:54:24,845 --> 00:54:26,267
Not yours.

715
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:30,518
Mr Stark would like to
avoid the possibility

716
00:54:30,684 --> 00:54:32,482
of another public incident.

717
00:54:32,853 --> 00:54:36,903
Until the Accords are on
a more secure foundation.

718
00:54:39,485 --> 00:54:41,533
And what do you want?

719
00:54:42,654 --> 00:54:44,156
For people to see you...

720
00:54:45,032 --> 00:54:46,534
as I do.

721
00:55:19,691 --> 00:55:20,692
So, you like cats?

722
00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:22,532
- Sam.
- What?

723
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:25,289
Dude shows up dressed like a cat,
you don't wanna know more?

724
00:55:27,491 --> 00:55:29,243
Your suit... it's vibranium?

725
00:55:32,913 --> 00:55:35,132
The Black Panther
has been the protector

726
00:55:35,207 --> 00:55:37,130
of Wakanda for generations.

727
00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:41,510
A mantle, passed from warrior to warrior.

728
00:55:43,048 --> 00:55:45,801
And now, because your friend
murdered my father...

729
00:55:46,593 --> 00:55:49,267
I also wear the mantle of king.

730
00:55:50,097 --> 00:55:51,565
So, I ask you...

731
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:54,644
as both warrior and king...

732
00:55:55,853 --> 00:55:59,608
how long do you think you can
keep your friend safe from me?

733
00:56:19,418 --> 00:56:20,715
What's gonna happen to him?

734
00:56:20,878 --> 00:56:23,097
Same thing that ought to happen to you.

735
00:56:23,171 --> 00:56:25,390
Psychological evaluation
and extradition.

736
00:56:25,549 --> 00:56:27,267
This is Everett Ross,
Deputy Task Force Commander.

737
00:56:27,968 --> 00:56:28,969
What about a lawyer?

738
00:56:29,136 --> 00:56:30,809
Lawyer. That's funny.

739
00:56:31,138 --> 00:56:33,106
See their weapons are placed in lockup.

740
00:56:33,265 --> 00:56:35,142
We'll write you a receipt.

741
00:56:35,309 --> 00:56:38,654
I better not look out the window
and see anybody flying around in that.

742
00:56:44,693 --> 00:56:46,286
You'll be
provided with an office

743
00:56:46,361 --> 00:56:47,738
instead of a cell.

744
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:49,744
Now, do me a favour, stay in it?

745
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:52,458
I don't intend on going anywhere.

746
00:56:52,618 --> 00:56:56,248
For the record, this is what
making things worse looks like.

747
00:56:56,538 --> 00:56:57,664
He's alive.

748
00:56:57,998 --> 00:56:59,545
No.

749
00:56:59,791 --> 00:57:02,010
Romania was not Accords-sanctioned.

750
00:57:02,169 --> 00:57:03,796
Colonel Rhodes is supervising cleanup.

751
00:57:03,962 --> 00:57:05,885
Try not to break anything
while we fix this.

752
00:57:06,048 --> 00:57:08,426
Consequences? You bet
there'll be consequences.

753
00:57:08,592 --> 00:57:10,219
Obviously you can quote me on that,

754
00:57:10,302 --> 00:57:11,770
because I just said it. Anything else?

755
00:57:11,845 --> 00:57:12,892
Thank you, sir.

756
00:57:14,139 --> 00:57:15,436
"Consequences"?

757
00:57:15,557 --> 00:57:16,809
Secretary Ross
wants you both prosecuted.

758
00:57:17,059 --> 00:57:18,356
Had to give him something.

759
00:57:18,518 --> 00:57:19,815
I'm not getting that shield back, am I?

760
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:21,689
Technically, it's the
government's property.

761
00:57:21,772 --> 00:57:22,819
Wings, too.

762
00:57:22,981 --> 00:57:24,198
That's cold.

763
00:57:24,524 --> 00:57:25,776
Warmer than jail.

764
00:57:53,512 --> 00:57:55,606
Hey, you wanna see
something cool?

765
00:57:56,390 --> 00:57:58,563
I pulled something from Dad's archives.

766
00:58:00,018 --> 00:58:01,395
Felt timely.

767
00:58:05,399 --> 00:58:08,994
FDR signed the Lend-Lease bill
with these in 1941.

768
00:58:09,653 --> 00:58:12,577
Provided support to the Allies
when they needed it most.

769
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:14,741
Some would say it brought
our country closer to war.

770
00:58:16,451 --> 00:58:18,874
See? If not for these,
you wouldn't be here.

771
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:23,000
I'm trying to... What do you call it?

772
00:58:23,291 --> 00:58:25,259
That's an olive branch.

773
00:58:26,086 --> 00:58:27,588
Is that what you call it?

774
00:58:29,006 --> 00:58:31,475
Is Pepper here? I didn't see her.

775
00:58:32,718 --> 00:58:35,016
We're kinda...

776
00:58:35,595 --> 00:58:37,268
- Well, not kinda...
- Pregnant?

777
00:58:37,723 --> 00:58:39,225
No. Definitely not.

778
00:58:39,391 --> 00:58:41,189
We're taking a break.

779
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:42,568
It's nobody's fault.

780
00:58:44,146 --> 00:58:45,614
I'm so sorry, Tony. I didn't know.

781
00:58:46,398 --> 00:58:49,368
A few years ago, I almost lost her,
so I trashed all my suits.

782
00:58:50,485 --> 00:58:52,362
Then, we had to mop up HYDRA...

783
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:54,873
and then Ultron. My fault.

784
00:58:55,032 --> 00:58:58,252
And then, and then, and then,
I never stopped.

785
00:58:58,410 --> 00:59:00,788
Because the truth is I don't wanna stop.

786
00:59:02,164 --> 00:59:04,212
I don't wanna lose her.

787
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:07,002
I thought maybe the Accords
could split the difference.

788
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:12,803
In her defence, I'm a handful.

789
00:59:14,009 --> 00:59:16,478
Yet, Dad was a pain in the ass,

790
00:59:16,553 --> 00:59:18,351
but he and Mom always made it work.

791
00:59:18,513 --> 00:59:19,981
I'm glad Howard got married.

792
00:59:20,682 --> 00:59:22,650
I only knew him
when he was young and single.

793
00:59:22,809 --> 00:59:24,732
Oh, really? You two knew each other?

794
00:59:24,811 --> 00:59:26,188
He never mentioned that.

795
00:59:26,354 --> 00:59:28,982
Maybe only a thousand times.

796
00:59:29,608 --> 00:59:30,985
God, I hated you.

797
00:59:32,986 --> 00:59:34,613
I don't mean to make things difficult.

798
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:37,078
I know, because you're
a very polite person.

799
00:59:37,699 --> 00:59:39,997
If I see a situation pointed south...

800
00:59:40,827 --> 00:59:42,329
I can't ignore it.

801
00:59:42,412 --> 00:59:43,789
Sometimes I wish I could.

802
00:59:43,955 --> 00:59:45,002
No, you don't.

803
00:59:48,126 --> 00:59:49,628
No, I don't.

804
00:59:50,337 --> 00:59:51,338
Sometimes...

805
00:59:51,505 --> 00:59:54,554
Sometimes I wanna
punch you in your perfect teeth.

806
00:59:55,133 --> 00:59:56,601
But I don't wanna see you gone.

807
00:59:57,344 --> 00:59:58,846
We need you, Cap.

808
00:59:59,554 --> 01:00:03,024
So far, nothing's happened
that can't be undone, if you sign.

809
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:05,310
We can make the last 24 hours legit.

810
01:00:05,477 --> 01:00:07,696
Barnes gets transferred to
an American psych-centre...

811
01:00:07,854 --> 01:00:09,822
instead of a Wakandan prison.

812
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:23,003
I'm not saying it's impossible...

813
01:00:23,203 --> 01:00:25,205
but there would have to be safeguards.

814
01:00:25,372 --> 01:00:26,419
Sure.

815
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:28,296
Once we put out the PR fire,

816
01:00:28,375 --> 01:00:30,377
those documents can be amended.

817
01:00:30,544 --> 01:00:32,262
I'd file a motion to have
you and Wanda reinstated...

818
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:34,305
Wanda? What about Wanda?

819
01:00:34,589 --> 01:00:36,136
She's fine. She's confined
to the compound, currently.

820
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:37,516
Vision's keeping her company.

821
01:00:37,676 --> 01:00:38,643
Oh, God, Tony.

822
01:00:38,844 --> 01:00:41,188
Every time I think you see
things the right way...

823
01:00:41,346 --> 01:00:42,347
It's 100 acres with a lap pool.

824
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:43,477
It's got a screening room.

825
01:00:43,557 --> 01:00:44,729
There's worse ways to protect people.

826
01:00:44,808 --> 01:00:45,855
Protection?

827
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:47,652
Is that how you see this?

828
01:00:47,727 --> 01:00:49,775
This is protection? It's internment, Tony.

829
01:00:49,938 --> 01:00:51,281
- She's not a US citizen.
- Oh, come on, Tony.

830
01:00:51,356 --> 01:00:52,858
And they don't grant visas
to weapons of mass destruction.

831
01:00:52,941 --> 01:00:53,942
She's a kid!

832
01:00:54,025 --> 01:00:55,402
Give me a break!

833
01:00:56,611 --> 01:00:58,659
I'm doing what has to be done.

834
01:00:58,822 --> 01:01:00,620
To stave off something worse.

835
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:05,537
You keep telling yourself that.

836
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:09,962
Hate to break up the set.

Hello?

850
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:20,828
Hey!

851
01:02:41,258 --> 01:02:44,011
Why would the Task Force
release this photo to begin with?

852
01:02:44,386 --> 01:02:46,684
Get the word out,
involve as many eyes as we can?

853
01:02:46,846 --> 01:02:49,725
Right. It's a good way
to flush a guy out of hiding.

854
01:02:49,891 --> 01:02:51,893
Set off a bomb, get your picture taken.

855
01:02:52,060 --> 01:02:54,188
Get seven billion people looking
for the Winter Soldier.

856
01:02:54,271 --> 01:02:56,114
You're saying someone
framed him to find him?

857
01:02:56,273 --> 01:02:57,274
Steve, we looked
for the guy for two years

858
01:02:57,357 --> 01:02:58,404
and found nothing.

859
01:02:58,525 --> 01:03:00,527
We didn't bomb the UN.
That turns a lot of heads.

860
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:01,953
Yeah,
but that doesn't guarantee

861
01:03:02,028 --> 01:03:03,200
that whoever framed him would get him.

862
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:05,123
It guarantees that we would.

863
01:03:11,204 --> 01:03:12,046
Yeah.

864
01:03:14,958 --> 01:03:16,380

<i>I don't wanna talk about it.</i>

867
01:03:23,216 --> 01:03:25,844
You fear that if you open your mouth,

868
01:03:25,927 --> 01:03:27,725
the horrors might never stop.

869
01:03:31,391 --> 01:03:32,483
Don't worry.

870
01:03:35,603 --> 01:03:37,901
We only have to talk about one.

871

Come on, guys, get me eyes on Barnes.

Certainly not Brooklyn, no.

Please tell me you brought a suit.

Sure did. It's a lovely Tom Ford,
three-piece, two-button.

You used to wear newspapers

Can't read that in a museum.

Oh, God, I knew this would happen.

Everything HYDRA
put inside me is still there.

930
01:11:50,556 --> 01:11:52,399
All he had to do
was say the goddamn words.

931
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:54,227
- Who was he?
- I don't know.

932
01:11:54,393 --> 01:11:56,361
People are dead.
The bombing, the setup...

933
01:11:56,562 --> 01:11:58,906
the doctor did all that just
to get 10 minutes with you.

934
01:11:59,148 --> 01:12:00,900
I need you to do
better than "I don't know."

935
01:12:04,612 --> 01:12:07,240
He wanted to know about Siberia.

936
01:12:09,909 --> 01:12:11,627
Where I was kept.

937
01:12:13,412 --> 01:12:15,164
He wanted to know exactly where.

938
01:12:15,414 --> 01:12:17,633
Why would he need to know that?

939
01:12:19,710 --> 01:12:22,054
Because I'm not the only Winter Soldier.

940

01:14:22,750 --> 01:14:23,876
Who were they?

944
01:14:24,043 --> 01:14:25,636
Their most elite death squad.

945
01:14:25,795 --> 01:14:27,889
More kills than anyone
in HYDRA history.

946
01:14:28,047 --> 01:14:29,344
And that was before the serum.

947
01:14:29,507 --> 01:14:30,633
They all turn out like you?

948
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:31,892
Worse.

949
01:14:32,510 --> 01:14:34,308
The doctor, could he control them?

950
01:14:35,262 --> 01:14:36,684
Enough.

951
01:14:36,847 --> 01:14:38,690
Said he wanted to see an empire fall.

952
01:14:38,933 --> 01:14:40,560
With these guys, he could do it.

953
01:14:40,851 --> 01:14:43,195
They speak 30 languages,
can hide in plain sight...

954
01:14:43,270 --> 01:14:45,489
infiltrate, assassinate, destabilise.

955
01:14:45,564 --> 01:14:47,111
They can take a whole country down

956
01:14:47,191 --> 01:14:48,659
in one night,
you'd never see them coming.

957
01:14:51,362 --> 01:14:53,410
This would have been
a lot easier a week ago.

958
01:14:53,990 --> 01:14:56,118
- If we call Tony...
- No, he won't believe us.

959
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:57,201
Even if he did...

960
01:14:57,284 --> 01:14:59,082
Who knows if the Accords
would let him help.

961
01:15:00,538 --> 01:15:01,539
We're on our own.

962
01:15:02,957 --> 01:15:03,799
Maybe not.

963
01:15:05,876 --> 01:15:07,423
I know a guy.

964
01:15:08,379 --> 01:15:11,349
I don't suppose you have
any idea where they are?

965
01:15:11,424 --> 01:15:12,391
We Will.

966
01:15:12,591 --> 01:15:14,184
GSG 9's got the borders covered.

967
01:15:14,260 --> 01:15:16,058
Recon's flying 24/7.

968
01:15:16,220 --> 01:15:17,722
They'll get a hit. We'll handle it.

969
01:15:17,805 --> 01:15:19,648
You don't get it, Stark.
It's not yours to handle.

970
01:15:19,890 --> 01:15:22,234
It's clear you can't be objective.

971
01:15:22,393 --> 01:15:23,895
I'm putting Special Ops on this.

972
01:15:23,978 --> 01:15:25,150
What happens
when the shooting starts?

973
01:15:25,229 --> 01:15:26,526
What, do you kill Steve Rogers?

974
01:15:26,605 --> 01:15:27,948
If we're provoked.

975
01:15:28,107 --> 01:15:31,407
Barnes would've been eliminated
in Romania if it wasn't for Rogers.

976
01:15:31,569 --> 01:15:35,369
There are dead people
who would be alive now.

977
01:15:36,449 --> 01:15:38,292
Feel free to check my math.

978
01:15:38,492 --> 01:15:39,835
All due respect,
you're not gonna solve this

979
01:15:39,910 --> 01:15:41,162
with boys and bullets, Ross.

980
01:15:41,245 --> 01:15:42,462
You gotta let us bring them in.

981
01:15:42,705 --> 01:15:44,628
How would that end
any differently than last time?

982
01:15:44,790 --> 01:15:45,757
Because this time,

983
01:15:45,833 --> 01:15:47,460
I won't be wearing loafers
and a silk shirt.

984
01:15:48,794 --> 01:15:50,671
72 hours, guaranteed.

985
01:15:50,838 --> 01:15:52,681
36 hours.

986
01:15:54,216 --> 01:15:55,513
Barnes.

987
01:15:57,011 --> 01:15:58,354
Rogers.

988
01:15:59,138 --> 01:16:00,105
Wilson.

989
01:16:00,181 --> 01:16:01,979
Thank you, sir.

990
01:16:05,603 --> 01:16:07,480
My left arm is numb. Is that normal?

991
01:16:10,941 --> 01:16:12,033
You all right?

992
01:16:12,193 --> 01:16:13,285
Always.

993
01:16:17,364 --> 01:16:19,617
36 hours. Jeez.

994
01:16:19,784 --> 01:16:21,832
We're seriously understaffed.

995
01:16:21,994 --> 01:16:23,166
Oh, yeah.

996
01:16:23,329 --> 01:16:26,299
It'd be great if we had
a Hulk right about now. Any shot?

997
01:16:28,250 --> 01:16:30,878
You really think he'd be on our side?

998
01:16:31,045 --> 01:16:32,092
No.

999
01:16:32,254 --> 01:16:33,551
I have an idea.

1000
01:16:33,714 --> 01:16:36,012
Me, too. Where's yours?

1001
01:16:36,217 --> 01:16:38,015
Downstairs.

1002
01:16:38,177 --> 01:16:39,349
Where's yours?

1003
01:17:01,325 --> 01:17:02,702
Hey, May.

1004
01:17:02,868 --> 01:17:04,040
Mmm. Hey.

1005
01:17:06,163 --> 01:17:07,915
How was school today?

1006
01:17:08,082 --> 01:17:09,334
It was okay.

1007
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:11,798
This crazy car parked outside.

1008
01:17:15,297 --> 01:17:17,265
- Oh, Mr Parker.
- Um...

1009
01:17:19,260 --> 01:17:21,308
What are you doing...

1010
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:23,268
Hey! Uh, I'm Peter.

1011
01:17:23,430 --> 01:17:24,682
Tony.

1012
01:17:25,182 --> 01:17:26,729
What are you doing here?

1013
01:17:26,892 --> 01:17:28,189
It's about time we met.

1014
01:17:28,269 --> 01:17:29,987
You've been getting my emails, right?

1015
01:17:30,187 --> 01:17:31,780
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Right?

1016
01:17:31,981 --> 01:17:32,982
Regarding the...

1017
01:17:33,065 --> 01:17:34,066
You didn't even tell me about the grant.

1018
01:17:34,233 --> 01:17:35,735
- About the grant.
- The September Foundation.

1019
01:17:35,901 --> 01:17:36,868
- Right.
- Yeah.

1020
01:17:36,944 --> 01:17:37,945
Remember when you applied?

1021
01:17:38,070 --> 01:17:39,117
Yeah.

1022
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:41,783
I approved, so now we're in business.

1023
01:17:42,408 --> 01:17:44,376
But you didn't tell me anything.
What's up with that?

1024
01:17:44,618 --> 01:17:45,585
You keeping secrets from me now?

1025
01:17:45,786 --> 01:17:49,586
I just know how much you love surprises
so I thought I would let you know...

1026
01:17:50,249 --> 01:17:51,751
Anyway, what did I apply for?

1027
01:17:51,917 --> 01:17:52,918
That's what I'm here to hash out.

1028
01:17:53,085 --> 01:17:54,462
Okay. Hash it out, okay.

1029
01:17:54,545 --> 01:17:57,173
It's so hard for me to believe
that she's someones aunt.

1030
01:17:57,339 --> 01:17:59,592
Yeah, well, we come in
all shapes and sizes, you know?

1031
01:18:00,050 --> 01:18:02,223
This walnut date loaf is exceptional.

1032
01:18:02,511 --> 01:18:03,763
- Let me just stop you there.
- Yeah.

1033
01:18:03,929 --> 01:18:07,729
Is this grant got money
involved or whatever? No?

1034
01:18:07,892 --> 01:18:09,144
Yeah, it's pretty well funded.

1035
01:18:09,226 --> 01:18:10,398
Yeah? Wow.

1036
01:18:10,477 --> 01:18:12,104
Look who you're talking to.

1037
01:18:12,271 --> 01:18:14,319
- Can I have five minutes with him?
- Sure.

1038
01:18:20,237 --> 01:18:23,537
As walnut date loaves go,
that wasn't bad.

1039
01:18:24,825 --> 01:18:27,624
Whoa, what have we here?
Retro tech, huh?

1040
01:18:27,828 --> 01:18:29,580
Thrift store? Salvation Army?

1041
01:18:29,788 --> 01:18:31,665
- Uh, the garbage, actually.
- You're a dumpster diver?

1042
01:18:31,874 --> 01:18:32,966
Yeah, I was...

1043
01:18:33,042 --> 01:18:34,510
Anyway, look, um,

1044
01:18:34,585 --> 01:18:36,132
I definitely did not apply
for your grant...

1045
01:18:36,378 --> 01:18:37,925
- Ah-ah! Me first.
- Okay.

1046
01:18:38,005 --> 01:18:40,508
Quick question of the rhetorical variety.

1047
01:18:41,842 --> 01:18:43,810
That's you, right?

1048
01:18:44,178 --> 01:18:45,179
Um, no.

1049
01:18:45,346 --> 01:18:46,814
- What do you mean?
- Yeah.

1050
01:18:47,806 --> 01:18:49,433
Look at you go.

1051
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:52,729
Wow! Nice catch.
3,000 pounds, 40 miles an hour.

1052
01:18:52,895 --> 01:18:55,648
That's not easy. You got mad skills.

1053
01:18:55,898 --> 01:18:57,741
That's all on YouTube, though, right?

1054
01:18:57,816 --> 01:18:59,318
That's where you found that?

1055
01:18:59,485 --> 01:19:00,532
Because you know that's all fake.

1056
01:19:00,611 --> 01:19:01,612
It's all done on the computer.

1057
01:19:01,862 --> 01:19:02,909
Mmm-hmm.

1058
01:19:02,988 --> 01:19:05,082
It's like that video. What is it?

1059
01:19:05,241 --> 01:19:07,039
Yeah. Oh, you mean like
those UFOs over Phoenix?

1060
01:19:07,201 --> 01:19:08,123
Exactly.

1061
01:19:08,535 --> 01:19:09,832
Oh, what have we here?

1062
01:19:11,205 --> 01:19:12,923
Uh...

1063
01:19:18,963 --> 01:19:20,806
You're the Spider-ling.

1064
01:19:20,965 --> 01:19:22,842
Crime-fighting spider.
You're Spider-Boy?

1065
01:19:25,678 --> 01:19:27,271
Spider-Man.

1066
01:19:27,638 --> 01:19:29,481
Not in that onesie, you're not.

1067
01:19:30,015 --> 01:19:31,938
It's not a onesie.

1068
01:19:33,352 --> 01:19:34,649
I don't believe this.
I was actually having

1069
01:19:34,728 --> 01:19:36,526
a really good day today, Mr Stark.

1070
01:19:36,689 --> 01:19:39,863
Didn't miss my train, this perfectly good
DVD player was just sitting there...

1071
01:19:40,484 --> 01:19:43,112
and Algebra test, nailed it.

1072
01:19:43,904 --> 01:19:45,372
Who else knows? Anybody?

1073
01:19:46,949 --> 01:19:48,075
Nobody.

1074
01:19:48,450 --> 01:19:50,452
Not even your unusually attractive aunt?

1075
01:19:50,619 --> 01:19:51,916
No. No.

1076
01:19:52,079 --> 01:19:54,673
No! If she knew, she would freak out.

1077
01:19:54,832 --> 01:19:56,550
And when she freaks out, I freak out.

1078
01:19:56,834 --> 01:19:58,757
You know what I think
is really cool? This webbing.

1079
01:20:00,129 --> 01:20:02,507
That tensile strength is off the charts.

1080
01:20:02,589 --> 01:20:03,966
Who manufactured that?

1081
01:20:04,258 --> 01:20:05,475
I did.

1082
01:20:06,552 --> 01:20:08,145
Climbing walls, how you doing that?

1083
01:20:08,304 --> 01:20:09,556
Adhesive gloves?

1084
01:20:09,722 --> 01:20:11,019
It's a long story. I was...

1085
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:13,859
Lordy! Can you even see in these?

1086
01:20:14,018 --> 01:20:15,019
Yes, I can.

1087
01:20:15,185 --> 01:20:16,357
I'm blind!

1088
01:20:17,313 --> 01:20:18,906
I can see in those.

1089
01:20:19,064 --> 01:20:19,906
Okay?

1090
01:20:20,065 --> 01:20:22,409
It's just that when whatever
happened,happened“.

1091
01:20:22,484 --> 01:20:24,782
It's like my senses
have been dialled to 11.

1092
01:20:25,321 --> 01:20:29,622
There's way too much input,
so they just kinda help me focus.

1093
01:20:29,908 --> 01:20:32,206
You're in dire need of an upgrade.

1094
01:20:32,286 --> 01:20:34,664
Systemic, top to bottom,
hundred-point restoration.

1095
01:20:34,747 --> 01:20:35,873
That's why I'm here.

1096
01:20:38,792 --> 01:20:39,918
Why you doing this?

1097
01:20:41,337 --> 01:20:42,509
I gotta know, what's your MO?

1098
01:20:42,588 --> 01:20:43,931
What gets you outta that
twin bed in the morning?

1099
01:20:45,132 --> 01:20:46,349
Because“.

1100
01:20:50,387 --> 01:20:52,355
Because I've been me my whole life,

1101
01:20:52,431 --> 01:20:54,104
and I've had these powers
for six months.

1102
01:20:54,558 --> 01:20:55,730
Mmm-hmm.

1103
01:20:55,809 --> 01:20:58,187
I read books, I build computers.

1104
01:20:59,396 --> 01:21:02,070
Yeah, I would love to play football,

1105
01:21:02,149 --> 01:21:03,696
but I couldn't then, so I shouldn't now.

1106
01:21:03,942 --> 01:21:05,444
Sure, because you're different.

1107
01:21:05,611 --> 01:21:08,535
Exactly. But I can't tell
anybody that, so I'm not.

1108
01:21:12,242 --> 01:21:16,543
When you can do the things
that I can, but you don't...

1109
01:21:18,957 --> 01:21:21,085
and then the bad things happen...

1110
01:21:21,835 --> 01:21:23,462
they happen because of you.

1111
01:21:28,133 --> 01:21:30,727
So you wanna look out for the little guy,
you wanna do your part?

1112
01:21:30,886 --> 01:21:33,105
Make the world
a better place, all that, right?

1113
01:21:33,347 --> 01:21:35,896
Yeah, just looking out for the little guy.

1114
01:21:36,892 --> 01:21:38,485
That's what it is.

1115
01:21:45,734 --> 01:21:47,907
I'm gonna sit here, so you move the leg.

1116
01:21:56,829 --> 01:21:58,046
You got a passport?

1117
01:21:58,122 --> 01:21:59,499
No, I don't even have a driver's license.

1118
01:21:59,665 --> 01:22:01,133
- You ever been to Germany?
- No.

1119
01:22:01,208 --> 01:22:02,209
Oh, you'll love it.

1120
01:22:02,418 --> 01:22:04,341
- I can't go to Germany.
- Why?

1121
01:22:06,797 --> 01:22:08,014
I got homework.

1122
01:22:08,674 --> 01:22:10,597
I'm gonna pretend you didn't say that.

1123
01:22:10,843 --> 01:22:12,720
No, I'm being serious.
I can't just drop out of school.

1124
01:22:12,928 --> 01:22:14,020
Might be a little dangerous.

1125
01:22:14,096 --> 01:22:15,939
Better tell Aunt Hottie
I'm taking you on a field trip.

1126
01:22:18,809 --> 01:22:20,652
Don't tell Aunt May.

1127
01:22:21,478 --> 01:22:22,570
All right, Spider-Man.

1128
01:22:26,191 --> 01:22:27,408
Get me out of this.

1129
01:22:27,568 --> 01:22:28,615
Sorry. I'll get the...

1130
01:22:41,540 --> 01:22:42,792
What is it?

1131
01:22:42,958 --> 01:22:44,380
Stay here, please.

1132
01:22:51,008 --> 01:22:52,510
Guess I shoulda knocked.

1133
01:22:52,843 --> 01:22:56,097
Oh, my God! What are you doing here?

1134
01:22:56,263 --> 01:22:58,561
Disappointing my kids.

1135
01:23:02,102 --> 01:23:03,854
I'm supposed to go waterskiing.

1136
01:23:04,354 --> 01:23:06,152
Cap needs our help. Come on.

1137
01:23:06,482 --> 01:23:07,483
Clint!

1138
01:23:09,401 --> 01:23:10,698
You should not be here.

1139
01:23:13,030 --> 01:23:14,282
Really?

1140
01:23:14,781 --> 01:23:17,876
I retire for, what, like five minutes,
and it all goes to shit.

1141
01:23:18,118 --> 01:23:20,337
Please consider
the consequences of your actions.

1142
01:23:20,496 --> 01:23:21,418
Okay, they're considered.

1143
01:23:22,873 --> 01:23:24,375
Okay, we gotta go.

1144
01:23:28,754 --> 01:23:30,051
It's this Way.

1145
01:23:30,506 --> 01:23:32,429
I've caused enough problems.

1146
01:23:36,970 --> 01:23:38,472
You gotta help me, Wanda.

1147
01:23:38,639 --> 01:23:40,357
Look, you wanna mope,
you can go to high school.

1148
01:23:40,516 --> 01:23:42,564
You wanna make amends,
you get off your ass.

1149
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:44,186
Shit.

1150
01:23:51,151 --> 01:23:52,903
I knew I should've stretched.

1151
01:24:06,500 --> 01:24:09,003
Clint, you can't overpower me.

1152
01:24:09,169 --> 01:24:11,012
I know I can't.

1153
01:24:11,588 --> 01:24:13,181
But she can.

1154
01:24:14,716 --> 01:24:17,811
Vision, that's enough. Let him go.

1155
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:19,721
I'm leaving.

1156
01:24:19,846 --> 01:24:20,972
Ican1letyou.

1157
01:24:26,019 --> 01:24:27,362
I'm sorry.

1158
01:24:30,857 --> 01:24:32,700
If you do this...

1159
01:24:33,151 --> 01:24:36,155
they will never stop being afraid of you.

1160
01:24:37,614 --> 01:24:40,959
I can't control their fear, only my own.

1161
01:24:53,171 --> 01:24:54,423
Oh...

1162
01:24:56,341 --> 01:24:58,810
Come on. We got one more stop.

1163
01:24:59,636 --> 01:25:01,354
It's just a matter of time.

1164
01:25:01,430 --> 01:25:04,183
Our satellites are running
facial, biometric,

1165
01:25:04,266 --> 01:25:05,893
and behavioural pattern scans.

1166
01:25:10,063 --> 01:25:12,612
Move or you will be moved.

1167
01:25:13,900 --> 01:25:16,574
As entertaining as that would be...

1168
01:25:16,737 --> 01:25:18,910
You really think you can find him?

1169
01:25:19,406 --> 01:25:21,079
My resources are considerable.

1170
01:25:21,241 --> 01:25:23,619
Yeah, it took the world
70 years to find Barnes...

1171
01:25:23,702 --> 01:25:26,205
so you could probably do that
in about half the time.

1172
01:25:27,414 --> 01:25:29,087
You know where they are.

1173
01:25:29,249 --> 01:25:31,343
I know someone who does.

1174
01:25:34,087 --> 01:25:36,636
Not sure you understand
the concept of a getaway car.

1175
01:25:36,715 --> 01:25:37,716
It's low profile.

1176
01:25:38,342 --> 01:25:41,095
Good, because this stuff
tends to draw a crowd.

1177
01:25:42,929 --> 01:25:44,431
Can you move your seat up?

1178
01:25:44,598 --> 01:25:45,724
No.

1179
01:25:45,974 --> 01:25:47,021
I owe you again.

1180
01:25:47,643 --> 01:25:49,236
Keeping a list.

1181
01:25:52,356 --> 01:25:54,108
You know, he kinda tried to kill me.

1182
01:25:55,025 --> 01:25:57,744
Sorry. I'll put it on the list, too.

1183
01:26:01,073 --> 01:26:03,292
They're going to come looking for you.

1184
01:26:03,367 --> 01:26:04,243
I know.

1185
01:26:07,162 --> 01:26:08,539
Thank you, Sharon.

1186
01:26:24,096 --> 01:26:25,097
That was...

1187
01:26:25,263 --> 01:26:26,185
Late.

1188
01:26:26,264 --> 01:26:27,106
Damn right.

1189
01:26:31,770 --> 01:26:32,771
I should go.

1190
01:26:32,938 --> 01:26:33,939
Okay.

1191
01:26:58,505 --> 01:26:59,677
Cap.

1192
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:02,059
You know I wouldn't have called
if I had any other choice.

1193
01:27:02,134 --> 01:27:03,511
Hey, man, you're doing me a favour.

1194
01:27:03,677 --> 01:27:06,021
Besides, I owe a debt.

1195
01:27:06,179 --> 01:27:07,726
Thanks for having my back.

1196
01:27:07,889 --> 01:27:09,391
It was time to get off my ass.

1197
01:27:09,975 --> 01:27:11,602
How about our other recruit?

1198
01:27:11,768 --> 01:27:13,361
He's rarin' to go.

1199
01:27:14,146 --> 01:27:15,363
Had to put a little coffee in him...

1200
01:27:16,690 --> 01:27:17,816
but he should be good.

1201
01:27:21,194 --> 01:27:22,696
What time zone is this?

1202
01:27:22,863 --> 01:27:24,706
Come on. Come on.

1203
01:27:27,826 --> 01:27:29,749
- Captain America!
- Mr Lang.

1204
01:27:30,829 --> 01:27:31,830
It's an honour.

1205
01:27:32,372 --> 01:27:34,090
I'm shaking your hand too long.

1206
01:27:34,249 --> 01:27:35,501
Wow! This is awesome!

1207
01:27:35,709 --> 01:27:38,303
Captain America.
I know you, too. You're great!

1208
01:27:42,048 --> 01:27:43,049
Jeez.

1209
01:27:43,216 --> 01:27:45,014
Ah, look, I wanna say,

1210
01:27:45,093 --> 01:27:47,187
I know you know
a lot of super people, so...

1211
01:27:48,138 --> 01:27:49,981
thinks for thanking of me.

1212
01:27:50,223 --> 01:27:51,941
- Hey, man!
- What's up, Tic Tao?

1213
01:27:52,184 --> 01:27:53,185
Uh, good to see you.

1214
01:27:53,268 --> 01:27:54,736
Look, what happened last time when I...

1215
01:27:54,936 --> 01:27:58,065
It was a great audition,
but it'll never happen again.

1216
01:27:58,356 --> 01:28:00,529
They tell you what we're up against?

1217
01:28:00,817 --> 01:28:03,912
Something about
some psycho-assassins?

1218
01:28:04,362 --> 01:28:06,285
We're outside the law on this one.

1219
01:28:06,364 --> 01:28:08,332
So if you come with us,
you're a wanted man.

1220
01:28:08,867 --> 01:28:10,289
Yeah, well, what else is new?

1221
01:28:10,535 --> 01:28:11,377
We should get moving.

1222
01:28:11,578 --> 01:28:13,296
We got a chopper lined up.

1223
01:28:17,918 --> 01:28:19,716
They're evacuating the airport.

1224
01:28:19,878 --> 01:28:20,970
Stark.

1225
01:28:21,046 --> 01:28:21,842
Stark?

1226
01:28:23,507 --> 01:28:25,100
Suit up.

1227
01:28:45,737 --> 01:28:47,831
<i>Wow, it's so weird
how you run into people at the airport.</i>

1228
01:28:47,906 --> 01:28:49,533
- Don't you think that's weird?
- Definitely weird.

1229
01:28:49,616 --> 01:28:50,913
Hear me out, Tony.

1230
01:28:50,992 --> 01:28:54,041
That doctor, the psychiatrist,
he's behind all of this.

1231
01:28:57,415 --> 01:28:58,507
<i>Captain.</i>

1232
01:28:58,667 --> 01:28:59,463
Your Highness.

1233
01:29:00,168 --> 01:29:01,169
Anyway...

1234
01:29:01,586 --> 01:29:03,634
Ross gave me 36 hours to bring you in.

1235
01:29:03,797 --> 01:29:06,721
That was 24 hours ago.
Can you help a brother out?

1236
01:29:06,967 --> 01:29:08,310
You're after the wrong guy.

1237
01:29:08,510 --> 01:29:10,433
Your judgment is askew.

1238
01:29:11,096 --> 01:29:13,019
Your old war buddy killed
innocent people yesterday.

1239
01:29:13,306 --> 01:29:16,105
And there are five more
super soldiers just like him.

1240
01:29:16,184 --> 01:29:18,653
I can't let the doctor
find them first, Tony. I can't.

1241
01:29:18,937 --> 01:29:19,984
BLACK WIDOWI Steve...

1242
01:29:21,022 --> 01:29:23,024
you know what's about to happen.

1243
01:29:23,108 --> 01:29:25,452
Do you really wanna
punch your way out of this one?

1244
01:29:29,656 --> 01:29:31,533
All right, I've run out of patience.

1245
01:29:31,616 --> 01:29:32,617
Underoos!

1246
01:29:38,582 --> 01:29:40,425
- Nice job, kid.
- Thanks.

1247
01:29:40,500 --> 01:29:42,343
I could have stuck the landing
a little better, it's just...

1248
01:29:42,502 --> 01:29:44,345
New suit. It's nothing, Mr Stark.

1249
01:29:44,504 --> 01:29:45,630
It's perfect. Thank you.

1250
01:29:45,797 --> 01:29:47,470
Yeah, we don't really need
to start a conversation.

1251
01:29:47,632 --> 01:29:48,724
Okay. Cap. Captain.

1252
01:29:49,968 --> 01:29:51,140
Big fan. I'm Spider-Man.

1253
01:29:51,386 --> 01:29:52,228
Yeah, we'll talk about it later.

1254
01:29:52,429 --> 01:29:54,227
- Hey, everyone.
- Good job.

1255
01:29:54,723 --> 01:29:55,724
You've been busy.

1256
01:29:55,891 --> 01:29:57,939
And you've been a complete idiot.

1257
01:29:58,018 --> 01:29:58,985
Dragging in Clint...

1258
01:29:59,144 --> 01:30:00,612
"Rescuing" Wanda from a place

1259
01:30:00,687 --> 01:30:02,815
she doesn't even want
to leave, a safe place.

1260
01:30:02,981 --> 01:30:04,233
I'm trying to keep...

1261
01:30:05,525 --> 01:30:08,529
I'm trying to keep you from
tearing the Avengers apart.

1262
01:30:09,112 --> 01:30:11,331
You did that when you signed.

1263
01:30:12,324 --> 01:30:13,496
All right, we're done.

1264
01:30:14,200 --> 01:30:15,702
You're gonna turn Barnes over,

1265
01:30:15,785 --> 01:30:17,958
you're gonna come with us,
now, because it's us...

1266
01:30:18,496 --> 01:30:19,873
or a squad of J-SOC guys...

1267
01:30:20,165 --> 01:30:22,668
with no compunction
about being impolite.

1268
01:30:24,669 --> 01:30:25,841
Come on.

1269
01:30:27,005 --> 01:30:28,552
<i>FALCON". We found it.</i>

1270
01:30:29,841 --> 01:30:31,935
Their Quinjet's in
hangar five, north runway.

1271
01:30:36,139 --> 01:30:37,436
All right, Lang.

1272
01:30:38,516 --> 01:30:40,268
Hey, guys, something...

1273
01:30:40,685 --> 01:30:41,686
Whoa.
What the hell was that?

1274
01:30:41,853 --> 01:30:43,855
<i>I believe this is yours, Captain America.</i>

1275
01:30:44,022 --> 01:30:45,023
Oh, great.

1276
01:30:45,190 --> 01:30:46,442
All right, there's two
on the parking deck.

1277
01:30:46,524 --> 01:30:47,867
One of them's Maximoff,
I'm gonna grab her.

1278
01:30:48,109 --> 01:30:49,531
<i>Rhodey, you wanna take Cap?</i>

1279
01:30:49,736 --> 01:30:51,738
<i>Got two in the terminal,
Wilson and Barnes.</i>

1280
01:30:51,905 --> 01:30:52,747
<i>Barnes is mine.</i>

1281
01:30:54,282 --> 01:30:55,625
Hey, Mr Stark, what should I do?

1282
01:30:55,867 --> 01:30:56,709
What we discussed.

1283
01:30:56,785 --> 01:30:57,661
Keep your distance, web them up.

1284
01:30:57,869 --> 01:30:59,086
Okay, copy that.

1285
01:31:03,959 --> 01:31:05,461
<i>Move, Captain.</i>

1286
01:31:05,710 --> 01:31:07,303
<i>I won't ask a second time.</i>

1287
01:31:09,631 --> 01:31:11,099
<i>Look, I really don't want to hurt you.</i>

1288
01:31:11,758 --> 01:31:13,180
I wouldn't stress about it.

1289
01:31:25,397 --> 01:31:26,740
What the hell is that?

1290
01:31:26,898 --> 01:31:28,992
Everyone's got a gimmick now.

1291
01:31:35,532 --> 01:31:36,909
You have a metal arm?

1292
01:31:37,075 --> 01:31:38,622
That is awesome, dude.

1293
01:31:40,370 --> 01:31:41,747
You have the right to remain silent!

1294
01:31:56,594 --> 01:31:57,937
<i>Sorry, Cap, this won't kill you...</i>

1295
01:31:58,054 --> 01:31:59,226
but it ain't gonna tickle either.

1296
01:32:04,602 --> 01:32:06,525
<i>Wanda, I think you hurt
Vision's feelings.</i>

1297
01:32:06,688 --> 01:32:08,110
You locked me in my room.

1298
01:32:08,314 --> 01:32:09,736
<i>Okay, first, that's an exaggeration.</i>

1299
01:32:09,816 --> 01:32:12,160
<i>Second, I did it to protect you.</i>

1300
01:32:12,402 --> 01:32:13,619
<i>- Hey, Clint.
- Hey, man.</i>

1301
01:32:13,820 --> 01:32:15,447
<i>Clearly, retirement doesn't suit you.</i>

1302
01:32:15,697 --> 01:32:17,165
<i>You got tired of shooting golf?</i>

1303
01:32:17,323 --> 01:32:19,701
Well, I played 18, shot 18.

1304
01:32:20,618 --> 01:32:21,835
Just can't seem to miss.

1305
01:32:24,456 --> 01:32:25,753
<i>First time for everything.</i>

1306
01:32:25,915 --> 01:32:26,791
Made you look.

1307
01:32:37,469 --> 01:32:39,187
<i>Multiple contusions detected.</i>

1308
01:32:39,345 --> 01:32:40,972
Yeah, I detected that, too.

1309
01:32:48,855 --> 01:32:49,902
Oh, God!

1310
01:32:51,191 --> 01:32:52,818
Hey, buddy, I think you lost this!

1311
01:32:58,364 --> 01:32:59,536
Ahh!

1312
01:33:04,913 --> 01:33:06,210
Those wings carbon fibre?

1313
01:33:06,414 --> 01:33:07,666
Is this stuff coming out of you?

1314
01:33:07,957 --> 01:33:09,459
That would explain
the rigidity-flexibility ratio,

1315
01:33:09,542 --> 01:33:10,964
which, gotta say, that's awesome, man.

1316
01:33:11,127 --> 01:33:12,720
I don't know if you've
been in a fight before...

1317
01:33:12,879 --> 01:33:14,381
but there's usually not this much talking.

1318
01:33:14,631 --> 01:33:15,678
All right, sorry. My bad.

1319
01:33:20,762 --> 01:33:22,389
Guys, look, I'd love to keep this up,

1320
01:33:22,472 --> 01:33:24,099
but I've only got one job here today...

1321
01:33:24,349 --> 01:33:27,319
and I gotta impress Mr Stark,
so, I'm really sorry.

1322
01:33:30,939 --> 01:33:32,941
You couldn't have done that earlier?

1323
01:33:33,399 --> 01:33:34,571
I hate you.

1324
01:33:41,157 --> 01:33:42,158
<i>Great.</i>

1325
01:33:42,367 --> 01:33:43,744
<i>Hey, Cap, heads-up!</i>

1326
01:33:45,453 --> 01:33:46,830
<i>Throw it at this.</i>

1327
01:33:47,413 --> 01:33:48,460
<i>Now!</i>

1328
01:33:51,960 --> 01:33:53,257
<i>Oh, come on!</i>

1329
01:33:56,214 --> 01:33:59,013
<i>Oh, man, I thought it was a water truck.</i>

1330
01:33:59,717 --> 01:34:01,060
<i>Uh, sorry.</i>

1331
01:34:03,054 --> 01:34:04,397
<i>All right, now I'm pissed.</i>

1332
01:34:05,348 --> 01:34:06,691
Is this part of the plan?

1333
01:34:06,850 --> 01:34:08,397
<i>Well, my plan was go easy on them.</i>

1334
01:34:08,476 --> 01:34:09,568
<i>You wanna switch it up?</i>

1335
01:34:12,021 --> 01:34:12,988
There's our ride.

1336
01:34:15,483 --> 01:34:16,484
Come on!

1337
01:34:25,451 --> 01:34:26,543
Captain Rogers...

1338
01:34:27,579 --> 01:34:30,583
I know you believe
what you're doing is right.

1339
01:34:31,374 --> 01:34:33,217
But for the collective good...

1340
01:34:33,376 --> 01:34:35,720
you must surrender now.

1341
01:34:52,812 --> 01:34:54,439
What do we do, Cap?

1342
01:34:55,440 --> 01:34:56,908
We fight.

1343
01:34:58,484 --> 01:35:00,111
This is gonna end well.

1344
01:35:06,868 --> 01:35:08,290
They're not stopping.

1345
01:35:08,453 --> 01:35:09,170
Neither are we.

1346
01:35:40,443 --> 01:35:41,569
We're still friends, right?

1347
01:35:41,736 --> 01:35:43,204
Depends on how hard you hit me.

1348
01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:54,048
You were pulling your punches.

1349
01:35:58,461 --> 01:35:59,678
I didn't kill your father.

1350
01:35:59,921 --> 01:36:01,548
<i>Then why did you run?</i>

1351
01:36:19,732 --> 01:36:21,780
That thing does not obey
the laws of physics at all.

1352
01:36:22,026 --> 01:36:23,699
Look, kid, there's a lot going on here
that you don't understand.

1353
01:36:23,987 --> 01:36:25,580
Mr Stark said you'd say that. Wow.

1354
01:36:35,081 --> 01:36:37,129
He also said to go for your legs.

1355
01:36:44,590 --> 01:36:45,591
Ahhh!

1356
01:36:48,886 --> 01:36:50,229
Clint, can you get him off me?

1357
01:36:50,388 --> 01:36:51,560
Buckled in?

1358
01:36:51,723 --> 01:36:53,145
Yeah. No, I'm <i>good.</i>

1359
01:36:53,308 --> 01:36:55,356
<i>I'm good, Arrow Guy. Let's go!</i>

1360
01:37:17,081 --> 01:37:18,458
Stark tell you anything else?

1361
01:37:18,624 --> 01:37:21,503
That you're wrong.
You think you're right.

1362
01:37:21,919 --> 01:37:23,296
That makes you dangerous.

1363
01:37:28,301 --> 01:37:29,723
Guess he had a point.

1364
01:37:34,807 --> 01:37:36,935
You got heart, kid. Where you from?

1365
01:37:37,602 --> 01:37:38,819
Queens.

1366
01:37:40,438 --> 01:37:41,439
Brooklyn.

1367
01:37:47,403 --> 01:37:48,450
<i>Friday?</i>

1368
01:37:48,529 --> 01:37:49,746
<i>We have some
weapon systems offline.</i>

1369
01:37:49,822 --> 01:37:50,823
What?

1370
01:37:51,157 --> 01:37:53,410
<i>Oh, you're gonna have to
take this into the shop.</i>

1371
01:37:53,701 --> 01:37:55,044
Who's speaking?

1372
01:37:55,203 --> 01:37:58,924
<i>It's your conscience.
We don't talk a lot these days.</i>

1373
01:37:59,123 --> 01:38:00,124
Fflday?

1374
01:38:00,208 --> 01:38:01,505
<i>Deploying fire
suppression system.</i>

1375
01:38:02,668 --> 01:38:03,669
<i>Uh-oh.</i>

1376
01:38:05,630 --> 01:38:06,631
<i>Oh, boy!</i>

1377
01:38:09,342 --> 01:38:10,343
<i>Whoa!</i>

1378
01:38:15,973 --> 01:38:18,067
We gotta go.
That guy's probably in Siberia by now.

1379
01:38:18,351 --> 01:38:19,603
<i>We gotta draw out the “vets.</i>

1380
01:38:19,769 --> 01:38:21,521
I'll take Vision, you get to the jet.

1381
01:38:21,813 --> 01:38:23,440
No, you get to the jet!

1382
01:38:23,564 --> 01:38:24,360
<i>Both of you!</i>

1383
01:38:26,984 --> 01:38:28,327
The rest of us aren't getting out of here.

1384
01:38:28,486 --> 01:38:29,487
As much as I hate to admit it...

1385
01:38:29,654 --> 01:38:31,122
<i>if we're gonna win this one,</i>

1386
01:38:31,197 --> 01:38:32,790
<i>some of us might have to lose it.</i>

1387
01:38:32,949 --> 01:38:34,997
<i>FALCON". This isn't the real fight, Steve.</i>

1388
01:38:35,159 --> 01:38:36,706
All right, Sam. What's the play?

1389
01:38:36,994 --> 01:38:39,088
We need a diversion. Something big.

1390
01:38:40,832 --> 01:38:42,459
<i>ANT-MAN". I got something kinda big.</i>

1391
01:38:42,542 --> 01:38:43,885
<i>But I can't hold it very long.</i>

1392
01:38:44,293 --> 01:38:46,295
<i>On my signal, run like hell.</i>

1393
01:38:46,504 --> 01:38:49,098
<i>And if I tear myself in half...
don't come back for me.</i>

1394
01:38:49,173 --> 01:38:50,049
He's gonna tear himself in half?

1395
01:38:50,341 --> 01:38:51,809
You sure about this, Scott?

1396
01:38:52,009 --> 01:38:53,352
<i>I do it all the time.</i>

1397
01:38:53,553 --> 01:38:55,351
<i>I mean, once. In a lab.</i>

1398
01:38:55,513 --> 01:38:57,186
<i>Then I passed out.</i>

1399
01:38:57,348 --> 01:38:59,191
<i>I'm the boss, I'm the boss, I'm the boss.</i>

1400
01:39:15,241 --> 01:39:16,743
Holy shit!

1401
01:39:21,038 --> 01:39:22,915
Okay, tiny dude is big now.
He's big now.

1402
01:39:24,959 --> 01:39:26,051
I guess that's the signal.

1403
01:39:26,294 --> 01:39:27,762
Way to go, Tic Tao!

1404
01:39:29,630 --> 01:39:31,052
Give me back my Rhodey.

1405
01:39:34,719 --> 01:39:35,936
I got him.

1406
01:39:58,576 --> 01:40:01,125
Okay, anybody on our side
hiding any shocking

1407
01:40:01,204 --> 01:40:02,922
and fantastic abilities
they'd like to disclose...

1408
01:40:03,080 --> 01:40:04,206
I'm open to suggestions.

1409
01:40:12,340 --> 01:40:13,967
You wanna get to them...

1410
01:40:14,133 --> 01:40:15,259
<i>you gotta go through me.</i>

1411
01:40:26,229 --> 01:40:27,355
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

1412
01:40:42,286 --> 01:40:43,754
We haven't met yet.

1413
01:40:46,332 --> 01:40:47,959
- I'm Clint.
- I don't care.

1414
01:41:02,181 --> 01:41:03,228
Whoa!

1415
01:41:08,271 --> 01:41:09,272
Ahhh!

1416
01:41:15,861 --> 01:41:16,828
Get off!

1417
01:41:31,752 --> 01:41:33,470
<i>Something just flew in me!</i>

1418
01:41:57,695 --> 01:41:58,537
You're not gonna stop.

1419
01:41:59,363 --> 01:42:00,364
You know I can't.

1420
01:42:01,324 --> 01:42:02,450
I'm gonna regret this.

1421
01:42:06,120 --> 01:42:07,417
Go.

1422
01:42:13,085 --> 01:42:15,133
Hey, guys, you ever see
that really old movie,

1423
01:42:15,212 --> 01:42:17,135
<i>Empire Strikes Back?</i>

1424
01:42:17,381 --> 01:42:18,724
<i>Jesus, Tony, how old is this guy?</i>

1425
01:42:18,883 --> 01:42:19,930
I don't know, I didn't carbon-date him.

1426
01:42:20,051 --> 01:42:21,052
He's on the young side.

1427
01:42:23,095 --> 01:42:26,224
You know that part
where they're on the snow planet...

1428
01:42:27,475 --> 01:42:28,977
with the walking thingies?

1429
01:42:31,395 --> 01:42:32,442
Maybe the kid's onto something.

1430
01:42:32,605 --> 01:42:33,572
High now, Tony. Go high.

1431
01:42:42,073 --> 01:42:43,074
Yes!

1432
01:42:43,616 --> 01:42:45,209
That was awesome!

1433
01:42:59,924 --> 01:43:02,928
Does anyone have any orange slices?

1434
01:43:08,474 --> 01:43:09,475
Kid, you all right?

1435
01:43:09,684 --> 01:43:10,685
Whoa!

1436
01:43:11,602 --> 01:43:14,697
Same side. Guess who. Hi. It's me.

1437
01:43:14,855 --> 01:43:15,947
- Hey, man.
- Yeah.

1438
01:43:16,107 --> 01:43:17,324
- That was scary.
- Yeah.

1439
01:43:17,483 --> 01:43:19,110
You're done, all right?

1440
01:43:19,276 --> 01:43:20,243
What? I'm good, I'm fine.

1441
01:43:20,319 --> 01:43:21,366
You did a good job. Stay down.

1442
01:43:21,445 --> 01:43:22,617
No, it's good. I gotta get him back.

1443
01:43:22,780 --> 01:43:23,781
You're going home or I'll call Aunt May!

1444
01:43:23,948 --> 01:43:25,120
- Dude.
- You're done!

1445
01:43:25,282 --> 01:43:26,329
Wait.

1446
01:43:26,492 --> 01:43:29,496
Mr Stark, wait.
I'm not done. I'm not...

1447
01:43:31,664 --> 01:43:33,962
Okay, I'm done. I'm done.

1448
01:43:50,141 --> 01:43:52,360
I said
I'd help you find him, not catch him.

1449
01:43:52,893 --> 01:43:54,486
There's a difference.

1450
01:44:01,318 --> 01:44:02,160
I'm sorry.

1451
01:44:02,903 --> 01:44:03,995
Me, too.

1452
01:44:04,905 --> 01:44:05,872
It's as I said.

1453
01:44:06,407 --> 01:44:08,080
Catastrophe.

1454
01:44:21,005 --> 01:44:22,848
Vision, I got a bandit on my six.

1455
01:44:27,595 --> 01:44:28,596
<i>Vision! You copy?</i>

1456
01:44:28,763 --> 01:44:30,765
<i>Target his thruster,
turn him into a glider.</i>

1457
01:44:45,946 --> 01:44:47,072
<i>Rhodey!</i>

1458
01:44:48,866 --> 01:44:50,664
Tony, I'm flying dead stick.

1459
01:44:58,876 --> 01:45:00,253
Rhodes!

1460
01:45:12,598 --> 01:45:14,066
Read vitals.

1461
01:45:14,225 --> 01:45:15,477
<i>Heartbeat detected.</i>

1462
01:45:15,643 --> 01:45:17,645
<i>Emergency medical is on its way.</i>

1463
01:45:22,817 --> 01:45:23,739
I'm sorry.

1464
01:45:45,714 --> 01:45:47,432
- this is room 20]

1465
01:45:48,759 --> 01:45:50,386
Bacon onol blocl< coffee again Today?

1466
01:45:51,762 --> 01:45:53,309
You know me so well...

1467
01:45:54,932 --> 01:45:56,775
Hello? Your breakfast is here.

1468
01:45:57,768 --> 01:45:58,769
May I lef mysehc in?

1469
01:46:23,836 --> 01:46:25,463
What's gonna happen to your friends?

1470
01:46:34,054 --> 01:46:35,601
Whatever it is...

1471
01:46:36,181 --> 01:46:37,808
I'll deal with it.

1472
01:46:40,895 --> 01:46:42,738
I don't know if I'm worth all this, Steve.

1473
01:46:50,195 --> 01:46:51,822
What you did all those years...

1474
01:46:52,865 --> 01:46:54,367
It wasn't you.

1475
01:46:55,200 --> 01:46:56,998
You didn't have a choice.

1476
01:46:58,162 --> 01:46:59,789
I know.

1477
01:47:02,374 --> 01:47:04,593
But I did it.

1478
01:47:18,807 --> 01:47:20,935
How did this happen?

1479
01:47:21,143 --> 01:47:23,145
I became distracted.

1480
01:47:25,439 --> 01:47:27,567
I didn't think that was possible.

1481
01:47:28,984 --> 01:47:30,657
Neither did I.

1482
01:47:47,211 --> 01:47:50,215
<i>The doctors say
he shattered L4 through St.</i>

1483
01:47:50,381 --> 01:47:53,134
Extreme laceration to the spinal cord.

1484
01:47:53,300 --> 01:47:55,928
Probably looking at
some form of paralysis.

1485
01:47:59,264 --> 01:48:00,811
Steve's not gonna stop.

1486
01:48:01,600 --> 01:48:02,647
If you don't either,

1487
01:48:02,726 --> 01:48:03,898
Rhodey's gonna be
the best case scenario.

1488
01:48:04,144 --> 01:48:05,316
You let them go, Nat.

1489
01:48:05,479 --> 01:48:06,526
We played this wrong.

1490
01:48:06,689 --> 01:48:07,941
Ilvve"?

1491
01:48:08,399 --> 01:48:09,446
Boy, it must be hard to

1492
01:48:09,525 --> 01:48:10,572
shake the whole
double agent thing, huh?

1493
01:48:11,110 --> 01:48:12,828
It sticks in the DNA.

1494
01:48:14,238 --> 01:48:16,832
Are you incapable
of letting go of your ego...

1495
01:48:17,116 --> 01:48:19,084
for one goddamn second?

1496
01:48:23,414 --> 01:48:25,633
T'Challa told Ross what you did, so...

1497
01:48:26,959 --> 01:48:28,586
they're coming for you.

1498
01:48:29,628 --> 01:48:32,381
I'm not the one that needs
to watch their back.

1499
01:48:41,015 --> 01:48:42,392
What am I looking at, Friday?

1500
01:48:42,474 --> 01:48:44,852
<i>Priority upload
from Berlin police.</i>

1501
01:48:47,896 --> 01:48:49,398
Fire up the chopper.

1502
01:48:55,362 --> 01:48:57,160
<i>The Task Force
called for a psychiatrist</i>

1503
01:48:57,322 --> 01:48:58,949
<i>as soon as Barnes was captured.</i>

1504
01:48:59,158 --> 01:49:01,456
<i>The UN dispatched
Doctor Theo Broussard</i>

1505
01:49:01,577 --> 01:49:02,920
<i>from Geneva within the hour.</i>

1506
01:49:03,078 --> 01:49:04,751
<i>He was met by this man.</i>

1507
01:49:04,913 --> 01:49:05,914
Did you run
facial recognition yet?

1508
01:49:05,998 --> 01:49:06,999
<i>What do I I00k like?</i>

1509
01:49:07,416 --> 01:49:09,293
Uh, I don't know.
I've been picturing a redhead.

1510
01:49:09,460 --> 01:49:11,007
<i>You must be thinking of someone else.</i>

1511
01:49:11,128 --> 01:49:12,175
Must be.

1512
01:49:12,337 --> 01:49:15,011
<i>The fake doctor is actually
Colonel Helmut Zemo.</i>

1513
01:49:16,258 --> 01:49:18,431
<i>Sokovian Intelligence.</i>

1514
01:49:19,511 --> 01:49:21,479
<i>Zemo ran Echo Scorpion...</i>

1515
01:49:21,638 --> 01:49:24,107
<i>a Sokovian covert kill squad.</i>

1516
01:49:26,310 --> 01:49:27,812
What happened to the real Broussard?

1517
01:49:27,895 --> 01:49:29,772
<i>He was found dead
in a Berlin hotel room.</i>

1518
01:49:29,938 --> 01:49:32,657
<i>Where police also found
a wig and facial prosthesis...</i>

1519
01:49:32,816 --> 01:49:36,866
<i>approximating the appearance
of one James Buchanan Barnes.</i>

1520
01:49:37,905 --> 01:49:39,703
Son of a bitch.

1521
01:49:41,700 --> 01:49:43,668
- Get this to Ross.
- Yes, boss.

1522
01:51:17,296 --> 01:51:19,173
<i>This is Raft Prison Control.</i>

1523
01:51:19,298 --> 01:51:21,767
<i>You're cleared for landing, Mr Stark.</i>

1524
01:51:54,208 --> 01:51:56,176
So? You got the files?

1525
01:51:56,418 --> 01:51:57,590
Let's reroute the satellites,

1526
01:51:57,753 --> 01:51:59,676
start facial scanning for this Zemo guy.

1527
01:51:59,838 --> 01:52:01,932
You seriously think
I'm gonna listen to you

1528
01:52:02,299 --> 01:52:04,142
after that fiasco in Leipzig?

1529
01:52:04,343 --> 01:52:06,641
You're lucky you're not
in one of these cells.

1530
01:52:37,459 --> 01:52:40,087
The Futurist, gentlemen!

1531
01:52:40,254 --> 01:52:42,723
The Futurist is here!

1532
01:52:42,881 --> 01:52:44,178
He sees all!

1533
01:52:45,175 --> 01:52:48,270
He knows what's best for you,
whether you like it or not.

1534
01:52:48,845 --> 01:52:49,846
Give me a break, Barton.

1535
01:52:50,097 --> 01:52:52,566
<i>I had no idea
they'd put you here. Come on.</i>

1536
01:52:53,183 --> 01:52:55,857
Yeah, well, you knew
they'd put us somewhere, Tony.

1537
01:52:56,061 --> 01:52:59,190
Yeah, but not some
super-max floating ocean pokey.

1538
01:52:59,356 --> 01:53:01,734
This place is for maniacs.
This is a place for...

1539
01:53:01,900 --> 01:53:03,197
Criminals?

1540
01:53:04,403 --> 01:53:06,201
Criminals, Tony.

1541
01:53:06,697 --> 01:53:09,041
Think that's the word you're looking for.

1542
01:53:10,325 --> 01:53:11,372
Right?

1543
01:53:11,994 --> 01:53:14,042
That didn't used to mean me.

1544
01:53:14,246 --> 01:53:15,668
Or Sam, or Wanda.

1545
01:53:15,914 --> 01:53:17,461
But here we are.

1546
01:53:17,624 --> 01:53:19,297
- Because you broke the law.
- Yeah.

1547
01:53:19,459 --> 01:53:20,460
I didn't make you.

1548
01:53:21,920 --> 01:53:23,467
- La, la, la, la, la...
- You read it, you broke it.

1549
01:53:25,048 --> 01:53:27,221
You're all grown up,
you got a wife and kids.

1550
01:53:27,342 --> 01:53:28,639
I don't understand, why didn't you

1551
01:53:28,719 --> 01:53:30,642
think about them before
you chose the wrong side?

1552
01:53:31,763 --> 01:53:33,731
You gotta watch your back with this guy.

1553
01:53:35,017 --> 01:53:37,145
There's a chance he's gonna break it.

1554
01:53:38,645 --> 01:53:41,865
Hank Pym always said
you never can trust a Stark.

1555
01:53:42,691 --> 01:53:44,113
Who are you?

1556
01:53:44,860 --> 01:53:46,533
Come on, man.

1557
01:53:48,030 --> 01:53:49,077
How's Rhodes?

1558
01:53:49,239 --> 01:53:52,083
They're flying him to
Columbia Medical tomorrow...

1559
01:53:52,159 --> 01:53:53,331
so fingers crossed.

1560
01:53:54,995 --> 01:53:56,463
What do you need? They feed you yet?

1561
01:53:58,665 --> 01:54:00,167
You're the good cop, now?

1562
01:54:00,876 --> 01:54:02,674
I'm just the guy who needs
to know where Steve went.

1563
01:54:02,836 --> 01:54:04,429
Well, you better go get a bad cop...

1564
01:54:04,588 --> 01:54:06,636
because you're gonna have to
go Mark Fuhrman on my ass...

1565
01:54:06,798 --> 01:54:08,721
to get information out of me.

1566
01:54:08,967 --> 01:54:10,844
Well, I just knocked
the A out of their AV.

1567
01:54:11,053 --> 01:54:13,932
We got about 30 seconds before
they realise it's not their equipment.

1568
01:54:14,890 --> 01:54:15,937
What'd you do?

1569
01:54:16,099 --> 01:54:17,646
Get it back up!

1570
01:54:18,727 --> 01:54:19,273
Just look.

1571
01:54:20,729 --> 01:54:22,151
Because that...

1572
01:54:22,314 --> 01:54:24,316
is the fellow who was
supposed to interrogate Barnes.

1573
01:54:26,026 --> 01:54:28,575
Clearly, I made a mistake.
Sam, I was wrong.

1574
01:54:28,862 --> 01:54:30,284
That's a first.

1575
01:54:30,364 --> 01:54:31,991
Cap is definitely off the reservation...

1576
01:54:32,074 --> 01:54:33,576
but he's about to need
all the help he can get.

1577
01:54:34,117 --> 01:54:35,164
We don't know each other very well.

1578
01:54:35,243 --> 01:54:36,335
You don't have to...

1579
01:54:36,411 --> 01:54:38,630
Hey, it's all right.

1580
01:54:46,546 --> 01:54:48,173
Look, I'll tell you...

1581
01:54:48,340 --> 01:54:51,184
but you have to go alone and as a friend.

1582
01:54:52,969 --> 01:54:54,016
Easy.

1583
01:54:56,973 --> 01:54:57,974
Stark?

1584
01:54:58,600 --> 01:55:00,273
Did he give you anything on Rogers?

1585
01:55:00,435 --> 01:55:01,436
Nope. Told me to go to hell.

1586
01:55:01,603 --> 01:55:03,446
I'm going back to the compound instead,

1587
01:55:03,563 --> 01:55:05,531
but you can call me anytime.

1588
01:55:05,690 --> 01:55:07,192
I'll put you on hold.
I like to watch the line blink.

1589
01:56:16,887 --> 01:56:18,264
You remember that time
we had to ride back

1590
01:56:18,513 --> 01:56:20,732
from Rockaway Beach
in the back of that freezer truck?

1591
01:56:20,807 --> 01:56:23,060
Was that the time
we used our train money

1592
01:56:23,143 --> 01:56:24,315
to buy hot dogs?

1593
01:56:24,394 --> 01:56:27,489
You blew three bucks trying to win
that stuffed bear for a redhead.

1594
01:56:28,190 --> 01:56:29,191
What was her name, again?

1595
01:56:29,399 --> 01:56:31,117
Dolores. You called her Dot.

1596
01:56:31,651 --> 01:56:33,369
She's gotta be
a hundred years old right now.

1597
01:56:33,570 --> 01:56:34,617
So are we, pal.

1598
01:56:44,456 --> 01:56:46,550
He can't have
been here more than a few hours.

1599
01:56:46,708 --> 01:56:48,710
Long enough to wake them up.

1600
01:57:30,877 --> 01:57:31,878
You ready?

1601
01:57:32,045 --> 01:57:33,046
Yeah.

1602
01:57:46,643 --> 01:57:48,645
You seem a little defensive.

1603
01:57:49,980 --> 01:57:51,152
It's been a long day.

1604
01:57:51,940 --> 01:57:53,783
At ease, Soldier.
I'm not currently after you.

1605
01:57:53,942 --> 01:57:55,159
Then why are you here?

1606
01:57:56,236 --> 01:57:58,910
Could be your story's not so crazy.

1607
01:57:59,072 --> 01:57:59,948
Maybe.

1608
01:58:01,700 --> 01:58:04,499
Ross has no idea I'm here.
I'd like to keep it that way.

1609
01:58:05,579 --> 01:58:07,581
Otherwise, I gotta arrest myself.

1610
01:58:08,873 --> 01:58:10,466
Well, that sounds like a lot of paperwork.

1611
01:58:14,212 --> 01:58:15,509
It's good to see you, Tony.

1612
01:58:15,714 --> 01:58:16,556
You too, Cap.

1613
01:58:17,841 --> 01:58:20,094
Hey, Manchurian Candidate,
you're killing me.

1614
01:58:20,176 --> 01:58:22,178
There's a truce here. You can drop...

1615
01:58:42,115 --> 01:58:43,458
<i><i>I got heat signatures.</i>

1616
01:58:43,617 --> 01:58:45,085
HOW many?

1617
01:58:46,119 --> 01:58:47,996
<i>Uh, one.</i>

1618
01:59:06,640 --> 01:59:08,893
<i>If it's any comfort,</i>

1619
01:59:09,017 --> 01:59:10,519
<i>they died in their sleep.</i>

1620
01:59:17,567 --> 01:59:20,662
<i>Did you really think
I wanted more of you?</i>

1621
01:59:21,821 --> 01:59:23,539
What the hell?

1622
01:59:24,324 --> 01:59:26,122
<i>I'm grateful to them, though.</i>

1623
01:59:27,202 --> 01:59:28,749
<i>They brought you here.</i>

1624
01:59:33,458 --> 01:59:35,176
<i>Please, Captain.</i>

1625
01:59:35,335 --> 01:59:37,133
<i>The Soviets built
this chamber to withstand</i>

1626
01:59:37,212 --> 01:59:39,806
<i>the launch blast of UR-100 rockets.</i>

1627
01:59:39,964 --> 01:59:41,762
<i><i>I'm betting I could beat that.</i>

1628
01:59:41,925 --> 01:59:43,643
Oh, <i>I</i> 'm sure you could, Mr Stark.

1629
01:59:44,177 --> 01:59:45,679
<i>Given time.</i>

1630
01:59:46,179 --> 01:59:47,772
<i>But then you'd never know
why you came.</i>

1631
01:59:47,972 --> 01:59:50,441
You killed innocent people in Vienna
just to bring us here?

1632
01:59:57,232 --> 02:00:00,862
I've thought about
nothing else for over a year.

1633
02:00:01,528 --> 02:00:03,280
I studied you.

1634
02:00:03,780 --> 02:00:05,202
I followed you.

1635
02:00:05,824 --> 02:00:07,622
But now that you're standing here...

1636
02:00:07,784 --> 02:00:09,786
I just realised...

1637
02:00:11,955 --> 02:00:14,458
there's a bit of green
in the blue of your eyes.

1638
02:00:16,876 --> 02:00:19,345
How nice to find a flaw.

1639
02:00:19,921 --> 02:00:21,514
You're Sokovian.

1640
02:00:22,674 --> 02:00:24,176
Is that what this is about?

1641
02:00:24,342 --> 02:00:27,846
Sokovia was a failed state
long before you blew it to hell.

1642
02:00:27,971 --> 02:00:29,097
No.

1643
02:00:30,432 --> 02:00:33,402
I'm here because I made a promise.

1644
02:00:36,604 --> 02:00:37,821
You lost someone?

1645
02:00:41,693 --> 02:00:43,741
I lost everyone.

1646
02:00:45,572 --> 02:00:47,165
And so will you.

1647
02:00:53,455 --> 02:00:57,085
An empire toppled
by its enemies can rise again.

1648
02:00:58,168 --> 02:01:00,296
But one which crumbles from within?

1649
02:01:01,921 --> 02:01:03,423
That's dead.

1650
02:01:04,549 --> 02:01:05,550
Forever.

1651
02:01:14,392 --> 02:01:16,019
I know that road.

1652
02:01:18,396 --> 02:01:19,397
What is this?

1653
02:01:42,670 --> 02:01:44,297
<i>Help my wife.</i>

1654
02:01:45,423 --> 02:01:47,721
<i>Please. Help.</i>

1655
02:01:53,306 --> 02:01:54,398
<i>Sergeant Barnes?</i>

1656
02:01:56,142 --> 02:01:57,485
Howard!

1657
02:02:05,068 --> 02:02:06,115
<i>Howard!</i>

1658
02:02:43,523 --> 02:02:45,116
No, Tony.

1659
02:02:54,284 --> 02:02:55,501
Did you know?

1660
02:02:57,996 --> 02:02:59,248
I didn't know it was him.

1661
02:02:59,414 --> 02:03:01,837
Don't bullshit me, Rogers.
Did you know?

1662
02:03:05,712 --> 02:03:06,759
Yes.

1663
02:04:03,853 --> 02:04:05,196
Get out of here!

1664
02:04:16,658 --> 02:04:17,375
It wasn't him, Tony.

1665
02:04:17,533 --> 02:04:18,534
HYDRA had control of his mind!

1666
02:04:18,660 --> 02:04:19,411
Move!

1667
02:04:19,702 --> 02:04:20,703
It wasn't him!

1668
02:04:29,712 --> 02:04:31,055
<i>Left boot jet failing.</i>

1669
02:04:31,923 --> 02:04:34,051
<i>Flight systems compromised.</i>

1670
02:04:34,759 --> 02:04:35,635
Ah, crap.

1671
02:04:49,524 --> 02:04:51,242
He's not gonna stop. Go.

1672
02:05:14,257 --> 02:05:15,258
Come on, come on.

1673
02:05:15,425 --> 02:05:16,972
<i>Targeting system's
knackered, boss.</i>

1674
02:05:17,176 --> 02:05:18,098
I'm eyeballing it.

1675
02:05:36,779 --> 02:05:38,406
Do you even remember them?

1676
02:05:38,573 --> 02:05:40,291
I remember all of them.

1677
02:06:03,139 --> 02:06:05,141
This isn't gonna change what happened.

1678
02:06:05,308 --> 02:06:06,810
I don't care.

1679
02:06:07,351 --> 02:06:08,728
He killed my mom.

1680
02:07:10,206 --> 02:07:11,799
<i>You should have
seen his little face.</i>

1681
02:07:11,874 --> 02:07:13,547
<i>Just try, okay?</i>

1682
02:07:13,709 --> 02:07:15,552
<i>I'm going to bed.</i>

1683
02:07:15,711 --> 02:07:17,384
<i>I love you.</i>

1684
02:07:25,346 --> 02:07:27,769
I almost
killed the wrong man.

1685
02:07:28,891 --> 02:07:30,893
Hardly an innocent one.

1686
02:07:31,060 --> 02:07:32,903
This is all you wanted?

1687
02:07:33,729 --> 02:07:36,232
To see them rip each other apart.

1688
02:07:40,194 --> 02:07:42,822
My father lived outside the city.

1689
02:07:43,739 --> 02:07:46,083
I thought we would be safe there.

1690
02:07:46,701 --> 02:07:48,578
My son was excited.

1691
02:07:48,744 --> 02:07:51,588
He could see the Iron Man
from the car window.

1692
02:07:52,582 --> 02:07:55,802
I told my wife, "Don't worry.

1693
02:07:55,960 --> 02:07:59,931
"They're fighting in the city.
We're miles from harm."

1694
02:08:02,258 --> 02:08:04,602
When the dust cleared...

1695
02:08:05,428 --> 02:08:07,806
and the screaming stopped...

1696
02:08:08,556 --> 02:08:12,481
it took me two days
until I found their bodies.

1697
02:08:14,812 --> 02:08:16,405
My father...

1698
02:08:17,231 --> 02:08:20,781
still holding my wife and son in his arms.

1699
02:08:25,239 --> 02:08:27,241
And the Avengers?

1700
02:08:28,242 --> 02:08:29,994
They went home.

1701
02:08:31,954 --> 02:08:34,127
I knew I couldn't kill them.

1702
02:08:34,290 --> 02:08:36,793
More powerful men than me have tried.

1703
02:08:39,003 --> 02:08:41,256
<i>But, if I could get them
to kill each other...</i>

1704
02:08:45,801 --> 02:08:48,600
I'm sorry about your father.

1705
02:08:49,013 --> 02:08:50,856
He seemed a good man.

1706
02:08:52,642 --> 02:08:54,144
With a dutiful son.

1707
02:08:58,856 --> 02:09:00,654
Vengeance has consumed you.

1708
02:09:03,444 --> 02:09:05,788
It's consuming them.

1709
02:09:09,700 --> 02:09:11,794
I am done letting it consume me.

1710
02:09:15,498 --> 02:09:17,842
Justice will come soon enough.

1711
02:09:21,170 --> 02:09:23,013
Tell that to the dead.

1712
02:09:27,510 --> 02:09:30,229
The living are not done with you, yet.

1713
02:09:33,057 --> 02:09:35,526
<i>You can't beat him
hand-to-hand.</i>

1714
02:09:36,644 --> 02:09:37,816
Analyse his fight pattern.

1715
02:09:38,104 --> 02:09:39,276
<i>Scanning.</i>

1716
02:09:43,985 --> 02:09:45,032
<i>Countermeasures ready.</i>

1717
02:09:47,196 --> 02:09:48,118
Let's kick his ass.

1718
02:10:01,877 --> 02:10:03,174
He's my friend.

1719
02:10:03,921 --> 02:10:04,968
So was I.

1720
02:10:12,013 --> 02:10:14,107
<i>Stay down. Final warning.</i>

1721
02:10:28,571 --> 02:10:30,744
I could do this all day.

1722
02:11:37,098 --> 02:11:39,351
That shield doesn't belong to you.

1723
02:11:40,976 --> 02:11:42,649
You don't deserve it.

1724
02:11:42,812 --> 02:11:44,860
My father made that shield!

1725
02:12:20,516 --> 02:12:22,359
Meals at 8 and 5.

1726
02:12:22,518 --> 02:12:24,145
Toilet privileges twice a day.

1727
02:12:26,522 --> 02:12:28,695
Raise your voice, zap.

1728
02:12:29,358 --> 02:12:31,360
Touch the glass, zap.

1729
02:12:31,694 --> 02:12:33,696
You step out of line, you deal with me.

1730
02:12:33,863 --> 02:12:36,036
Please, step out of line, hmm?

1731
02:12:38,242 --> 02:12:39,664
So how does it feel?

1732
02:12:40,578 --> 02:12:43,047
To spend all that time, all that effort...

1733
02:12:45,916 --> 02:12:50,046
to see it fail so spectacularly?

1734
02:12:54,049 --> 02:12:55,301
Did it?

1735
02:13:20,784 --> 02:13:21,910
It's just the first pass.

1736
02:13:22,036 --> 02:13:23,003
Yeah.

1737
02:13:23,078 --> 02:13:25,126
Give me some feedback,
anything you think of.

1738
02:13:25,289 --> 02:13:27,963
Shock absorption, lateral movement.

1739
02:13:28,584 --> 02:13:29,585
Cup holder?

1740
02:13:29,752 --> 02:13:31,345
You may wanna think about
some AC down in...

1741
02:13:31,587 --> 02:13:32,634
Ow.

1742
02:13:35,216 --> 02:13:36,433
Let's go. I'll give you a hand.

1743
02:13:36,592 --> 02:13:38,265
No. Don't help me.

1744
02:13:41,472 --> 02:13:42,473
Ah.

1745
02:13:54,318 --> 02:13:55,615
138.

1746
02:13:56,445 --> 02:13:59,073
138 combat missions.

1747
02:13:59,240 --> 02:14:00,992
That's how many I've flown, Tony.

1748
02:14:01,242 --> 02:14:04,291
Every one of them
could've been my last, but I flew them.

1749
02:14:06,163 --> 02:14:07,710
Because the fight needed to be fought.

1750
02:14:08,207 --> 02:14:09,834
It's the same with these Accords.

1751
02:14:10,501 --> 02:14:14,005
I signed because it was
the right thing to do.

1752
02:14:15,965 --> 02:14:18,013
And yeah, this sucks. This is, uh...

1753
02:14:19,301 --> 02:14:21,144
This is a bad beat.

1754
02:14:23,180 --> 02:14:24,807
But it hasn't changed my mind.

1755
02:14:26,475 --> 02:14:27,852
I don't think.

1756
02:14:38,279 --> 02:14:39,656
- You okay?
- Oh, yeah.

1757
02:14:42,992 --> 02:14:45,996
Are you Tony Stank?

1758
02:14:46,203 --> 02:14:50,458
Yes, this is Tony Stank.
You're in the right place.

1759
02:14:50,624 --> 02:14:52,342
Thank you for that!

1760
02:14:52,501 --> 02:14:54,344
Never dropping that, by the way.

1761
02:14:54,503 --> 02:14:56,426
"Table for one, Mr Stank.

1762
02:14:56,505 --> 02:14:57,677
"Please, by the bathroom."

1763
02:15:04,221 --> 02:15:05,188
Tony...

1764
02:15:06,390 --> 02:15:08,358
<i>I'm glad you're back at the compound.</i>

1765
02:15:08,517 --> 02:15:11,566
<i>I don't like the idea of you
rattling around a mansion by yourself.</i>

1766
02:15:11,729 --> 02:15:13,106
<i>We all need family.</i>

1767
02:15:14,523 --> 02:15:18,369
<i>The Avengers are yours.
Maybe more so than mine.</i>

1768
02:15:19,153 --> 02:15:21,702
<i>I've been on my own since I was 18.</i>

1769
02:15:22,489 --> 02:15:25,163
<i>I never really fit in anywhere,</i>

1770
02:15:25,242 --> 02:15:27,085
<i>even in the Army.</i>

1771
02:15:28,704 --> 02:15:31,878
<i>My faith's in people, I guess.</i>

1772
02:15:32,041 --> 02:15:33,258
<i>Individuals.</i>

1773
02:15:34,209 --> 02:15:37,258
<i>And I'm happy to say that,
for the most part...</i>

1774
02:15:37,421 --> 02:15:39,048
<i>they haven't let me down.</i>

1775
02:15:41,050 --> 02:15:43,553
<i>Which is why I can't
let them down either.</i>

1776
02:15:47,514 --> 02:15:50,893
<i>Locks can be replaced,
but maybe they shouldn't.</i>

1777
02:15:52,770 --> 02:15:54,898
<i>I know I hurt you, Tony.</i>

1778
02:15:55,064 --> 02:15:58,159
<i>I guess I thought by not telling you
about your parents...</i>

1779
02:15:58,233 --> 02:16:00,577
<i>I was sparing you...</i>

1780
02:16:00,736 --> 02:16:03,410
<i>but I can see now that
I was really sparing myself.</i>

1781
02:16:03,906 --> 02:16:05,908
<i>And I'm sorry.</i>

1782
02:16:06,075 --> 02:16:08,248
<i>Hopefully one day you can understand.</i>

1783
02:16:09,119 --> 02:16:10,871
<i>I wish we agreed on the Accords.</i>

1784
02:16:10,954 --> 02:16:12,547
<i>I really do.</i>

1785
02:16:12,706 --> 02:16:14,208
<i>I know you're doing what you believe in,</i>

1786
02:16:14,291 --> 02:16:15,838
<i>and that's all any of us can do.</i>

1787
02:16:15,918 --> 02:16:17,295
<i>That's all any of us should.</i>

1788
02:16:17,378 --> 02:16:19,380
<i>Priority call
from Secretary Ross.</i>

1789
02:16:19,463 --> 02:16:21,761
<i>There's been a breach
at the Raft prison.</i>

1790
02:16:23,050 --> 02:16:24,802
Yeah, put him through.

1791
02:16:25,928 --> 02:16:27,396
<i>Tony, we have a problem.</i>

1792
02:16:27,471 --> 02:16:29,473
- Uh, please hold.
- No, don't.

1793
02:16:32,226 --> 02:16:33,603
<i>So no matter what...</i>

1794
02:16:34,770 --> 02:16:36,113
<i>I promise you...</i>

1795
02:16:36,230 --> 02:16:37,903
<i>if you need us...</i>

1796
02:16:38,774 --> 02:16:40,742
<i>if you need me...</i>

1797
02:16:44,988 --> 02:16:46,285
<i>I'll be there.</i>

1798
02:18:45,609 --> 02:18:46,656
You sure about this?

1799
02:18:48,862 --> 02:18:50,739
I can't trust my own mind.

1800
02:18:53,534 --> 02:18:56,128
So, until they figure out
how to get this stuff out of my head...

1801
02:18:56,286 --> 02:18:58,755
I think going back under
is the best thing.

1802
02:18:59,456 --> 02:19:00,958
For everybody.

1803
02:19:23,230 --> 02:19:24,607
Thank you for this.

1804
02:19:27,109 --> 02:19:29,157
Your friend and my father...

1805
02:19:30,112 --> 02:19:31,955
they were both victims.

1806
02:19:33,448 --> 02:19:36,793
If I can help one of them find peace...

1807
02:19:39,621 --> 02:19:42,340
You know, if they find out he's here...

1808
02:19:42,499 --> 02:19:44,547
they'll come for him.

1809
02:19:46,461 --> 02:19:48,134
Let them try.

1810
02:23:39,027 --> 02:23:43,453
<i>Hey, shady baby

1816
02:24:09,141 --> 02:24:11,894

Who was it? Who hit you?

1852
02:26:32,200 --> 02:26:33,372
Some guy.

1853
02:26:33,535 --> 02:26:35,162
So itchy, man, God.

1854
02:26:35,328 --> 02:26:36,545
What's "some guy's" name?

1855
02:26:36,705 --> 02:26:38,207
Uh, Steve.

1856
02:26:38,373 --> 02:26:40,375
Steve? From 12-C?

1857
02:26:40,542 --> 02:26:42,419
- With the overbite?
- No, no, no.

1858
02:26:42,711 --> 02:26:44,338
You don't know him. He's from Brooklyn.

1859
02:26:47,257 --> 02:26:48,258
Ouch.

1860
02:26:48,383 --> 02:26:49,384
Well...

1861
02:26:50,176 --> 02:26:51,928
I hope you got a few good licks in.

1862
02:26:52,178 --> 02:26:54,431
Yeah, I got quite a few in, actually.

1863
02:26:55,181 --> 02:26:58,230
His friend was huge. Like huge.

1864
02:27:00,729 --> 02:27:03,073
That's way better. Thank you.

1865
02:27:03,231 --> 02:27:05,233
Okay, tough 9W-

Love you, May.
Hey, can you shut the door?
